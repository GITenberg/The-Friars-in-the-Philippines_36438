<p class="first">The following pages originally appeared as magazine
articles. In both England and America the papers were favorably
received; and as the public has not heard the last of the Friars in the
Philippines, it seemed worth while to reproduce them in the more
permanent form of a small volume, making such corrections and additions
as might be deemed advisable. Whatever may be the shortcomings of the
book, there is a real and pressing need for the information it
contains, and this need must remain the excuse for its imperfections. A
fair consideration of the facts it presents is confidently expected
from a people whose love of justice is almost proverbial: Truth should
have nothing to fear from Americans.</p>

<p class="first">A recent traveller designates the Philippines as the
birthplace of typhoons, the home of earthquakes,&mdash;epithets
undoubtedly strong yet well deserved; and typhoons at certain seasons
of the year, with earthquakes at uncertain periods, when taken together
with the torrid heat, trying at all seasons, and the malaria fruitful
of fevers, make these islands of the Eastern seas, which otherwise
would be a veritable Paradise upon earth, an undesirable place of abode
to the average European, unless, indeed, he is attracted thither by the
greed of gain or by the nobler desire of missionary enterprise.</p>
<p>For Nature, bountiful there almost to prodigality, revelling in all
the luxuriance of tropical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href=
"#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>vegetation, has always at hand, as a
set-off to her gifts, terrible manifestations of her power. The
seventeenth-century navigator, William Dampier, in his own quaint and
amusing way, describes how the natives and the Spanish colonists of
Manila strove to guard against the double danger of earthquakes and
typhoons, and how they both failed ignominiously. The Spaniards built
strong stone houses, but the earthquake made light of them, and shook
them so violently that the terrified inmates would rush out of doors to
save their lives; while the natives from their frail bamboo dwellings,
which were perched on high poles, placidly contemplated their
discomfiture. All that the earthquake meant to them was a gentle
swaying from side to side. But the Spaniards had their turn when the
fierce typhoon blew, against which their thick walls were proof. Then,
from the security of their houses, could they view, with a certain grim
satisfaction, the huts of the natives swaying every minute more
violently in the wind, till, one by one, they toppled over&mdash;each
an indescribable heap of poles, mats, household utensils, and human
beings.</p>

<p>By way of general description it may be said that the Philippine
Archipelago consists of between one and two thousand islands; two of
which, Luzon and Mindanao, are much larger than Ireland, while the rest
vary in size down to mere islets, rocks, and reefs. Altogether the
islands <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>stretch from north to south a distance as great as
from the north of England to the south of Italy. The soil is extremely
rich, and easily cultivated; vast forests abound, containing valuable
timber; and the mineral resources, up to the present undeveloped, are
apt to prove a sure source of income under modern methods of
working.</p>
<p>But what concerns us most in this inquiry is the character of the
inhabitants. The population, which is variously estimated at from eight
to ten millions, is made up of more than eighty distinct tribes, which
nearly all belong to the Malay race. There are still to be found in
some of the islands, and principally in the mountainous districts, the
remnants of the aboriginal inhabitants, usually called Negritos. These
are of a distinctively inferior type, are rapidly diminishing in
numbers, and seem to many observers incapable of civilization. Our only
concern therefore is with the Malays, who form the vast bulk of the
population, and have in the course of time been nearly all converted to
Christianity. Nearly seven million Christians are counted among them;
while the unconverted pagans, together with the Moros, or Malay
Mohammedans, of Mindanao and the Sulu islands, are not a million in
number.</p>
<p>Christianity has effected a wonderful transformation in the
character of the people, softening and refining it, as we may judge by
the contrast presented by their cruel and bloodthirsty neighbors
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>in Mindanao and the Sulu group, who, nevertheless,
belong to the same race, and whose characteristics they must originally
have shared. Travellers have not sufficiently dwelt on this important
point. They note that the civilized native is self-respecting and
self-constrained to a remarkable degree, patient under misfortune, and
forbearing under provocation. He is a kind father and a dutiful son.
His relatives are never left in want, but are welcome to share the best
his house affords, to the end of their days. Unfortunately for himself,
he is a happy-go-lucky fellow, delighting in cock-fighting and games of
chance, and naturally indolent, his wants being so few and simple. He
is a born musician, genial, sociable, loving to dance, sing, and make
merry among his companions. His wife is allowed a degree of liberty
hardly equalled in any other Eastern country, a liberty she rarely
abuses. She is the financier of the family, and the husband consults
her when making a bargain. She does her share of the work; but it is
not more than her just share, and she is not overburdened with labor.
Hospitality is cheerful and open-handed, and the traveller is welcomed
to the hut of the native with cordiality. The houses of the natives are
kept neat, and are models of cleanliness, and the natives also keep
themselves extremely clean. They are practical and fervent Catholics.
At the vesper Angelus bell &ldquo;there is always a pretty scene. An
instant hush comes over the busy village. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>In each house father,
mother, and children fall on their knees before the image or picture of
some saint, and repeat their prayers. The devotions over, each child
kisses the hand of his father and his mother, at the same time wishing
them good evening. He then makes an obeisance to each of his brothers
and sisters, as well as to each guest who happens to be present,
repeating his salutation with each funny bow. Host and hostess also
greet one in the same way; and in remote places, where white men are a
rarity, the little tots often kneel to kiss one&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;
(&ldquo;The Philippine Islands and their People,&rdquo; by Dean C.
Worcester.)</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to the happy, contented, and peaceful character of
the Christian native, is his southern neighbor of the same blood, the
fanatical Moro. Mohammedanism has accentuated rather than softened the
underlying fierceness of the Malay; as it gives him a religious
sanction to cruelty, treachery, murder, pillage, and piracy when
directed against the hated Christian. Inhuman and cold-blooded cruelty
is the great characteristic of the Moro, who will calmly cut down a
slave merely to try the edge of a new weapon. For two centuries and a
half the Moros organized piratical expeditions against the northern
islands. The coming of the dreaded fleet of war-praus was looked
forward to as an annual event; and while the southwest monsoon was
blowing, vigilant sentinels were on the lookout night and day from the
watch-towers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>with which every village was provided. The
introduction of modern artillery and quick-firing guns at last turned
the scales in favor of the Spaniards, and the piratical expeditions are
now a thing of the past. All Christians, however, living near the Moros
must still carry their lives in their hands, owing to the
<i>juramentados</i>. A <i>juramentado</i> is a man who takes an oath to
die killing Christians. The more Christians he kills, the higher place
of course he is to get in heaven, especially if he loses his own life
in the holy work. He dresses in white, shaves his eyebrows, conceals a
weapon under his clothing, and then seizing a favorable opportunity,
runs amuck, killing without mercy men, women, and children. Of course
he gets killed himself in the end, but sometimes not until he has made
himself accountable for a great number of deaths.</p>
<p>Though Magellan discovered the Archipelago in 1521, no serious
attempt to take possession of it was made till 1565, when an expedition
of four hundred soldiers and sailors was fitted out by Philip II., and
placed under the leadership of Miguel Lopez de Legaspi. As Philip was
inspired by religious zeal, and his principal and perhaps only object
was to spread the light of the Gospel, six Augustinian friars
accompanied the expedition. We may say with truth that it was these
missionaries, and the others who followed in rapid succession, who
conquered the Archipelago <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=
"#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>for Spain. There was no conquest in
the strict sense of the term. The Spaniards in most places simply
showed themselves to the natives; and the religious, who accompanied
them, persuaded the untutored savages to submit to the King of Spain,
through whom they would obtain the two-fold blessing of civilization
and Christianity. The retention of these rich and fertile islands, so
great a source of revenue to the mother-country, was on the whole a
very easy task. The religious Orders planted themselves firmly in the
colony, and spread themselves everywhere, winning the natives to
Christ, keeping them also in loyal obedience to that great European
power by whose means the missionaries had been sent to them. They were
thus the real bulwarks of Spanish power there, which was kept up rather
by gentle persuasion than by force of arms. Mr. Mac Macking, a Scotch
Protestant who spent some years there, says: &ldquo;The warriors who
gained them over to Spain were not their steel-clad chivalry, but the
soldiers of the Cross,&mdash;the priests who astonished and kindled
them by their enthusiasm in the cause of Christ.&rdquo; Up to a few
years ago profound peace reigned; and a garrison of 4,200 soldiers,
3,500 gendarmerie, and 2,000 sailors and marines, was considered
sufficient to overawe a population of eight millions, besides keeping
in check the fanatical and bloodthirsty Moro pirates.</p>
<p>The Augustinians were the pioneers in religious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>enterprise, coming, as we said already, with
Legaspi, in 1565, four years before the Philippines were formally
annexed to Spain. They were followed, in 1577, by the Franciscans; and
the labors of both Orders were so successful that Manila was erected
into an <span class="corr" id="xd20e332" title=
"Source: espiscopal">episcopal</span> see in 1579. Two years later
Salazar, a Dominican friar laboring in Mexico, was appointed bishop;
and he brought the Dominicans with him to Manila. About the same time,
also, the Jesuits and the Recollects, or discalced Augustinians,
entered the country. All the Orders went about their work with truly
religious zeal; and their success was so great that at the end of the
century Mendoza could say: &ldquo;According to the common opinion, at
this day there are converted and baptized more than four hundred
thousand souls.&rdquo; It was a success to be proud of among a people
who, when the missionaries came, had no religious worship, nor temple,
nor priest, nor form of worship. They had but a hazy notion of a Deity,
their sole religious ideas consisting of some imperfect notions of a
hell and a heaven. Persecution only gave zest to the work, both in the
Philippines and in the Ladrones, of which we may speak together in this
connection, as they have a common history. Towards the close of the
sixteenth century, as we learn from Argensola, more than six thousand
Christians had already been martyred in the single province of Ternate,
&ldquo;that so,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;the foundation of our faith may
be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>in all parts cemented with the blood of the
faithful. They dismembered the bodies, and burned the legs and arms in
sight of the still living trunks. They impaled the women, and tore out
their bowels; children were torn piecemeal before their mothers&rsquo;
eyes, and infants were rent from their wombs.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Discovery
and Conquest of the Molucca and Philippine islands,&rdquo; by B. L. de
Argensola.) Opposition, and persecution too, came from the Mohammedan
element in the population, which was already formidable when the
Spaniards arrived on the scene, Mohammedanism having been introduced
into the islands, especially the more southerly group, as far back as
the thirteenth century. Accordingly the Mohammedans waged a long and
bitter warfare both against missionaries, and the new Christians,
numbers of whom were called on to seal their faith with their blood.
Still, in spite of persecution, the Church prospered in those early
days. Dampier, the English navigator, who visited the Philippines
towards the close of the seventeenth century, testifies to the
wonderful progress made even then in civilization. &ldquo;In every
village,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is a stone church, as well as a
parsonage-house for the rector, who is always one of the monks. These
last, who are all Europeans, are very much respected by the Indians,
while the secular clergy, who commonly are Creoles, are held in
contempt. Hence the Government shows great deference to the rectors;
for, generally speaking, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href=
"#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>the Indians always consult them on
entering on any enterprise, or even as to paying taxes.&rdquo; Thus,
one century had changed the people from savagery to civilization. In
Manila, Dampier found the natives pursuing all the avocations of
civilized life&mdash;they were merchants, skilled artisans in various
trades, clerks, etc.</p>
<p>There were three large colleges,&mdash;two under the care of the
Dominicans, and one carried on by the Augustinians. There was also a
Poor Clare convent, containing forty nuns, together with a hospital and
an orphanage. The religious establishments occupied one-third of the
city as it then stood. This may seem out of proportion to the religious
needs of the city; but we must remember that in Manila, then as now,
priests of the various Orders were in training for the numerous
missions of the Archipelago, Tonkin, and China (see Appendix I.), and,
at the period of which we are speaking, of Japan as well.</p>
<p>Passing on to the present century, the Rev. David Abeel, a
Protestant missionary, says of the Philippines: &ldquo;The Church of
Rome has here proselytized to itself the entire population. The
influence of the priests is unbounded.&rdquo; In the year 1858 Mr.
Crawford, who was formerly governor of Singapore, made the following
declaration at a public missionary meeting: &ldquo;In the Philippine
Islands the Spaniards have converted several millions of people to the
Roman Catholic faith, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17"
name="pb17">17</a>]</span>and an immense improvement in their social
condition has been the consequence.&rdquo; Mr. MacMacking confesses
that the suppression of the Jesuits, who were banished from the
Philippines in 1768, &ldquo;was attended with the worst effects to the
trade and agriculture of the islands.&rdquo; He adds that
&ldquo;religious processions are as frequently passing through the
streets as they are in the Roman Catholic countries of Europe.&rdquo;
He testifies that &ldquo;the Church has long proved to be, on the
whole, by much the most cheap and efficacious instrument of good
government and order&mdash;even the common people learn reading by its
aid, so much at least as to enable them to read their prayer-books and
other religious manuals. There are very few Indians who are unable to
read, and I have always observed that the Manila men serving on board
ships and forming their crew have been much oftener able to subscribe
their names to the ship&rsquo;s articles than the British seamen on
board the same vessels could do.&rdquo; Prosessor Ferdinand
Blumentritt, a German Protestant, who is universally acknowledged to be
the most competent authority on all that regards the Philippines, spoke
most highly of the missionary and scientific work of the Religious
Orders there, at a meeting of the Vienna Geographical Society in 1896.
The weight of testimony from such a source all must acknowledge; it is
indeed a pleasure to present the German scientist&rsquo;s remarks to
the consideration of fair-minded readers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to add some remarks,&rdquo; said Blumentritt,
&ldquo;about the Philippines, as here the Catholic missionaries are
usually active not only in the spread of Christianity and its
civilization, but also in the geographical and ethnographical
exploration of the archipelago. Unfortunately the reports of the
missions of the various Orders are not equally accessible, e.g., we
have very little account of the Augustinian missions, which are located
principally in the lands of the Igorrotes (Northwest Luzon) and on the
Island of Negros, among the Budkidnon savages. The only important
publication upon Augustinian missions which I have been able to see is
the <i lang="es">Memoria acerea de las Missiones de los P. P.
Augustinos Calzados</i>, Madrid, 1892. According to this the Calced
Augustinians in 1892 had in the province of Abra, among the Tinguians,
who inhabit it, eight missions with 25,100 souls; in that of Lepanto,
two missions with 2,200 souls (Igorrotes); in that of Bengnet, also two
missions, with 849 souls (Igorrotes)&mdash;total, 28,149 souls, as
against 5,302 in 1829. Between 1874 and 1885 the number of savages and
heathens converted to Christianity was 1,356; from 1885 to 1888 there
were 549. In 1892 the erection of 15 new missions was projected in the
provinces of Tiagan, Bontok, Amburayan, and Quiangan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Discalced Augustinians, called in the Philippines
&lsquo;Recoletos,&rsquo; have missions in the Island of Palawan (or
Paragua) and in the group <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href=
"#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>of the Calamianes. Of these
missioners, Father Cipriano Navarro has especially distinguished
himself by his ethnographical researches; and we owe to him exhaustive
reports concerning the Tinitians, Togbanuas, Tandolans, and
Bulalacaunos, among whom Christianity is making steady progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Franciscans have missions in the peninsula of Camarines,
in Luzon, and in every large island on the Pacific coast. Ethnography
and philology are much indebted to their labors. I need only refer to
the works published by myself in the proceedings of our Society, the
vocabulary of the Negrito dialect of Baler by Father Fernandez, and the
accounts of the Bikols, Dumagats, and Atas, by Father Castano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We possess fuller accounts of the Dominicans, who are
occupied in converting to Christianity the Alimis, Apayaos, Aripas,
Buayas, Bumanguis, Bungians, Calauas, Calingas, Catalangans, Dadayags,
Gaddans, Ibibalons, Ibilaos, and Ilongotes, Ipiutys, Isinays, Mayoyaos,
Guiangans, and other Ifuagao races. In the missionary review, <i>Correo
Sino-Anamito</i>, we find numerous descriptions of popular manners and
customs. Some of these, particularly those written by Fathers
Villaverde, Buenaventura, Campa, Malumbres, Ruis, and Ferrando, I have
already in part made more generally known in these proceedings. The
review also publishes occasional sketches, and especially such
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>as throw light on the river-system of North Luzon,
the valley of the Rio Grande de Cagayan. The results of their strictly
missionary labors are very fruitful.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;But however successful the evangelical and scientific
activity of the missionaries of the above Orders, they are far
surpassed by what the Jesuits have done in the island of Mindanaoin, in
half a generation, for the spread of Christianity and civilization, as
well as for the geographical exploration of the second largest island
of the Archipelago. When they arrived they found a Christian population
only on the east and north coasts, and in a few isolated spots on the
other coast regions, such as Zamboanga, Pollok, Cottabatto Davao, and
Pundaguitan; and these were mostly Bisayos, with a few Bukidnons,
Mandayas, Manabos, and Subanos. In the interior the Spanish Christian
settlements along the Macajalas Bay reached only as far as the upper
course of the Rio Tagoloan; on the Agusan, from the lake region at
Linao to its mouth near Butuan, only two villages, Bunauan and
Talacogon. All that was then known of the interior of Mindanao was the
Lanao Lake, the lower course of the Pulangin or Rio Grande from its
mouth to Lahabay, and the lake region belonging to the river of
Ligauasan or Buluan. Of the tribes over and above the Bisayas
(Christians) and Moros (Mohammedans), only the Mandayas, Manobos,
Subanos, and Budkidnon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21"
name="pb21">21</a>]</span>(or &lsquo;Monteses&rsquo; of the Spaniards)
were known by little more than name, but scarcely mentioned in
contemporary literature. Of the rest, except the Tirurayes, scarce the
name was known. Of the Atas, Tagabawas, Dulangans, Tagabelis, etc.,
even the names were unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How changed since then! The network of rivers in the great
island is now very well known; whilst the legendary lake in the centre
of the island, whence the Rio Grande was said to flow, and from which
the whole island was supposed to derive its name, has now happily
disappeared from our maps. In numerous sketches and maps the
missionaries have recorded the results of their geographical
explorations and discoveries. The manners and customs of the heathen
tribes have been fully described by the Jesuits. It has, therefore,
always been for me the greatest pleasure to communicate the results of
the researches of these Philippine missionaries to wider scientific
circles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jesuits can also point to very great results in their
evangelical labors. Most of the heathen tribes are now entirely or in
part converted to Christianity, or have at least settled round their
missions. Even a tribe so obstinately refractory to civilization, owing
to their unsettled and wandering life, as the Mamanuas (who belong to
the Negritos) can already point to Christian villages. But the greatest
success of the Jesuits has been in bringing a considerable number of
the Moros on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>the Gulf of Davao to embrace Christianity. When it
is remembered how rare a thing it is to induce a Mohammedan to be
baptized, it must be especially noted that here not a few isolated
Moros living among Christians have abjured Islam, but that the Moros
converted to Christianity are so numerous that, as they can no longer
live among their former co-religionists, they have been allowed to
build their separate villages in the region of the Rio Davao. In 1895
the status of the Jesuit missions was as follows: 213,065 souls, 17,608
baptisms of children of Christian parents, 2,973 marriages, 7,215
funerals, 8,238 baptisms of converted heathen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the article &lsquo;<span lang="de">Die Katholischen
Missionen</span>,&rsquo; Oscar Hecht gives the number of Christians in
the Philippines as 3,500,000. This is incorrect. The flocks of the
different Orders were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is difficult to estimate the number of heathens and Mohammedans;
they cannot be under 500,000, nor can they exceed a million.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any account of the work of the Religious Orders in the islands would
be certainly incomplete if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href=
"#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>particular mention of their efforts
in behalf of education were omitted. These efforts were systematically
carried out until interrupted by the recent rebellion. The briefest and
most summary mention of what each of the Orders has done, however, is
all that may be attempted within the necessary narrow limits of this
volumes.</p>
<p>1. The Dominicans are in charge of the University of Manila, which
was founded and confided to their care about two centuries ago. It has
been generally attended by between two and three thousand natives, who
thus receive the benefits of a professional and liberal education. A
correspondent of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> (London) tells his English
readers that as &ldquo;the education of the people has been exclusively
in their (the religious&rsquo;) hands, it is enough to say that
practically it does not exist.&rdquo; The following account of the
studies pursued in the University, taken from the official report of
the year 1893&ndash;1894, is a sufficient answer to this unworthy
remark.</p>
<p>COURSE OF STUDIES.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Theology and Canon Law has the following courses of
lectures:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1. A course of Ontology, Cosmology, and Natural Religion.</li>
<li>2. The Controversial Course.</li>
<li>3. Dogmatic Theology.</li>
<li>4. Moral Theology and Sacred Eloquence.</li>
<li>5. Sacred Scripture.<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href=
"#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span></li>
<li>6. Canon Law.</li>
<li>7. Ecclesiastical Procedure and Discipline, especially as used in
Churches in the East.</li>
<li>8. Ecclesiastical History.</li>
</ul>
<p>The eight lecturers in this faculty were Dominicans. There were
thirty students.</p>
<p>FACULTY OF JURISPRUDENCE.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Metaphysics.</li>
<li>2. Spanish Literature.</li>
<li>3. Constitutional History of Spain and Natural Law.</li>
<li>4. Canon Law.</li>
<li>5. Political Economy.</li>
<li>6. Ecclesiastical Discipline.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were six Dominican and nine other professors teaching in this
faculty. The students numbered 405.</p>
<p>FACULTY OF LAW.</p>
<p>In this faculty one Dominican and eleven other professors lectured.
There were 60 students.</p>
<p>FACULTY OF MEDICINE.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Physics.</li>
<li>2. Chemistry.</li>
<li>3. Mineralogy and Botany.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three Dominican and thirteen other professors lectured in this
faculty. There were 277 students.</p>
<p>FACULTY OF PHARMACY.</p>
<p>There were 89 students. In the schools of practical pharmacy there
were 216 students. Three Dominicans, who lectured on Chemistry,
Zo&ouml;logy, Mineralogy, and Botany, and seven other professors taught
in this faculty. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>This is the higher education which has been given to the natives for
more than two centuries. Is it not something to admire? Can England
point back to anything equal to it in the history of her own colonies?
Did England in the last century do anything for the material or
spiritual advancement of the North American Indians? Did the United
States do anything for them till within recent years? Both governments
folded their arms while the Indians were being driven before the face
of the white settlers; and during the two centuries that the policy of
extinction was being carried out on the North American continent the
Spanish missionaries were giving the natives of the Philippines all the
benefits of higher education. The contrast is instructive, and places
Spain on a far higher plane as a colonizer than her quondam rival.</p>
<p>Besides imparting higher education in the University, the Dominicans
gave secondary education in two colleges in Manila, to some hundreds of
scholars, one principally devoted to a classical education, and the
other suited to those intending to engage in a mercantile career.
Besides these they had colleges in the towns of Cebu, Jaro, Nueva,
Caceres, Dagupan, and Vigan.</p>
<p>2. The Jesuits. &ldquo;The labors of the Jesuits,&rdquo; says the
<i>Messenger of the Sacred Heart</i> (New York), are chiefly confined
to the Island of Mindanao. They direct, however, a flourishing college
at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>Manila, and are in charge of an observatory,
which, for the perfection of an outfit and the importance of its
observations, ranks foremost among institutions of its kind. This
famous observatory was founded by the Spanish Jesuits in 1865, and was
at first connected with their college at Manila. It was directed until
1896 by the well-known astronomer and meteorologist, Father Frederick
Faura. By its successful prediction of typhoons, so common and
destructive in the Philippines, the observatory soon won for itself an
enviable reputation throughout the archipelago. Up to the year 1882, no
fewer than fourteen of these dangerous tornadoes had been predicted. In
consideration of such valuable services, the observatory was, in April,
1884, raised to the rank of a Government institution, under the title
of &ldquo;Meteorological Observatory of Manila,&rdquo; and was
transferred to its present commodious quarters outside the city, with
which it has telegraphic and telephonic connections.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;The observatory comprises four departments,&mdash;the
meteorological, seismological, magnetic, and astronomical. Each
department has its special director, and a general director is at the
head of the whole establishment. The meteorological section, provided
with the very best instruments, is the most important of the four, on
account of its practical usefulness to shipping interests. It is in
regular communication with more than a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>hundred observatories in
all parts of the world. Twice every day it receives by cable the
meteorological observations made at the stations of Nagasaki, Tokio,
Kabe (Japan), Shanghai, Amoy, Hong Kong (China), Haiphong (Tonkin), the
Island of Formosa, and elsewhere along the coast. Hence the forecasting
of typhoons and cyclones is greatly facilitated, and enjoys the
confidence of all those that sail the Chinese seas. Many of the
instruments used at the observatory are due to the inventive genius of
Father Faura, who was also the first to announce typhoons with
certainty, and to discover the laws which regulate their formation and
path. He is the inventor of a peculiar kind of barometer, which enables
any sailor, even if he knows nothing whatever about meteorology, to
foresee the approach of storms, and to guard against them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next in importance to the meteorological department is the
seismological or earthquake section of the observatory, which is
rendering great services to a region so much exposed to earthquakes as
the Philippines are. This section is likewise equipped with a
remarkably fine apparatus, many of the instruments having been built or
improved by Father Faura. For many years Father Miguel Saderra Maso has
been in charge of this section, which he has made famous by his learned
work, &ldquo;Seismology in the Philippines,&rdquo; published in 1895.
Father Cirera&rsquo;s work, &ldquo;Terrestrial Magnetism <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>in the
Philippines,&rdquo; is also well known in the learned world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The splendid achievements of the Manila observatory found
their due meed of appreciation and praise in the congress of scientists
at the World&rsquo;s Fair, where the institution was represented by
Fathers Algerie and Faura, who came at that time to this country, and
spent some months at Georgetown College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Faura died in January, 1897. His death was that of a
martyr of charity. During his sickness, Ryzal (or Ryall), one of the
insurgent leaders, had been captured, and condemned to be shot within
twenty-four hours. The prisoner was placed in the Chapel of the
Passion, and was offered the spiritual ministration of the Jesuit
Fathers. But he peremptorily refused to see a priest on the plea that
he was a Protestant. Several of the fathers had already been repelled,
when Father Faura, who had formerly been Ryzal&rsquo;s professor at
Manila, rising from his bed of sickness, made a last effort to convert
the unfortunate man. Though at first repelled like the rest, he was at
last admitted by Ryzal; and after arguing and pleading with him for a
long time, he had the happiness of bringing him to repentance, and
restoring him to the Catholic Church. The condemned man made a sincere
confession, heard Mass, received Holy Communion, begged pardon for his
errors, and exhorted others to renounce all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>connection with Freemasonry. His conversion was
entire, and his death that of a fervent Christian. The effort to bring
about this conversion, however, cost Father Faura his own life. Worn
out and prostrated by the interview, he was led back to his bed to die.
The conversion of his former pupil was the last apostolic act of Father
Faura, and the crowning of a life of great usefulness in the service of
religion and of science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sons of St. Ignatius also direct the Municipal Academy of which
English correspondents have spoken in terms of high praise.</p>
<p>3. At Vigan also is the Augustinian Seminary and College, under the
direction of the fathers, seven of whom are teachers. Here 209 students
were taught the following branches (as set down in the report): viz.,
Dogmatic Theology, Moral Theology, Metaphysics, Logic, Ethics, Physics,
Chemistry, Geography, Poetry, Rhetoric, Trigonometry, Geometry,
Algebra, Arithmetic, Analysis, and translation of Latin, Greek, French,
Church History, Natural History, Universal History, History of Spain,
History of the Philippines, Christian Doctrine.</p>
<p>The Augustinians also conducted a splendid orphanage and industrial
school at Tambohn, about a league from Manila. In this establishment
145 boys were taught the following trades (Report for 1897&ndash;1898):
Compositors, 13; press-work, 12; bookbinders, 30; gilders, 3;
candle-makers, 43; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30"
name="pb30">30</a>]</span>together with forty-four others too young to
be trained.</p>
<p>4. Neither was the education of the female sex neglected. Among
other establishments of a like nature, there was an orphan asylum for
girls at Mandaloya on the Tasig, conducted by Augustinian nuns,
twenty-two in number. Last year it contained 122 pupils, who were
receiving instruction in music, the piano, painting, drawing,
embroidery, artificial flower-making, dressmaking, hair-dressing,
lacemaking, laundry work, and sewing.</p>
<p>5. The Franciscans had colleges as well, and besides doing their
share in the work of education, devoted their time and services to the
hospitals of the Archipelago, the principal of which are, the Royal
Hospital of St. Lazarus at Manila, the Infirmary of St. Ann in the
province of <span class="corr" id="xd20e560" title=
"Source: Saguna">Laguna</span>, and that of Vasa in the province of
Camarines.</p>
<p>Scattered through the various islands are the posts or residences,
where the fathers of the various Orders devote themselves to the
&ldquo;nuevos Christianos,&rdquo; as they are called, or latter-day
converts from Paganism. This zealous work of conversion has never
ceased from the time of the conquest, and the Christian population has
been steadily on the increase till our own times. The recent
traveller,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e565src" href="#xd20e565" name=
"xd20e565src">1</a> whom we quoted at the beginning, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>came in
contact a good deal with the Dominicans during his stay in the
Philippines, visiting several of their outlying stations, and receiving
everywhere the greatest kindness and hospitality from them. He says:
&ldquo;Everywhere you enter the monastery as though it was your own,
eat and drink unstintedly, and sleep, and depart with thanks and a
cordial God-speed from the fathers, and naught to pay for the
entertainment.&rdquo; Alas! the good fathers did not know the viper
they were nursing. Pity they could not recognize in the smiling
Englishman who so readily accepted their hospitality, and &ldquo;paid
naught for the entertainment,&rdquo; the man who would speak of them as
dirty monks, who would consider it worthy of sneering record that they
did not shave when on board ship, and who, though not able to discover
any evil himself, would repeat gross calumnies about them, got from
hearsay. What he saw with his own eyes belies his wicked innuendos. He
says: &ldquo;It was plain that they cared naught for the fretting of
the world. In many a dismal place, even in the remotest spots, I found
the clusters of monastic exiles perfectly happy&mdash;the outer world
dead, or too far away&mdash;craving for no other fate. They are
enchanted to welcome and give you of their best; will even, if
struggling overland, lend a vehicle or a ridinghorse to convey you to
the next convent on the way. Cheery, kindly, simple people, practical
sermons on &lsquo;Content.&rsquo; The monks of Ramblon, a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>dozen or
so all told, were delighted to show us all that was to be seen. A
homely little church was duly exhibited, built of a local wood, which
cuts into planks of extreme width, adorned with a grain which is
brought out with wax and oil. The columns were of solid ebony, the
floor of four marbles, white, gray, black, and brown. All these were
the products of this little island.&rdquo; A fair-minded man would have
duly attributed their joy of mind and kindness to strangers to
religious feeling,&mdash;to the love of God, for whose sake these
Spanish missionaries had given up father and mother, friends and
worldly prospects, to spend their lives, year in and year out, without
hope of earthly reward, in these spots, dismal enough to the ordinary
tourist, but to them bright and cheery, as they were the posts alloted
to them by Divine Providence for the extension of the Kingdom of Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The provincial stations,&rdquo; he says in another place,
&ldquo;are in reality governed by the priests.&rdquo; How could it be
otherwise? With a government notoriously weak and inefficient, with lay
officials notoriously corrupt, unwilling to exile themselves in these
parts remote from civilization, unwilling to condescend to learn the
many various dialects in use in the Archipelago, no wonder that the
missionary living in the midst of the people to whom he had devoted his
life, and who looked up to him as a father, exercised a sort of
parental authority over them. This was done both in the interest of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>the civil government and of the natives
themselves. The governors utilized the authority of the missionaries as
long as it suited their purpose; when, on the other hand, the
missionaries had to oppose extortion and unjust treatment, the
officials started the cry that the missionaries were ruling the
Archipelago. About those gentlemen Thomas Comin wrote in 1810:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;In order to be a chief of a province in these
islands no training, or knowledge, or special service is necessary. It
is quite a common thing to see a barber, a Governor&rsquo;s lackey, a
sailor, or a deserter suddenly transformed into an Alcalde,
Administrator, and Captain of the Forces of a populous province, with
no counsellor but his rude understanding, and no guide but his
passions.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Here are some edifying facts concerning Spanish officials in the
Philippines. In five years Governor-General Manuel de Arandia amassed a
quarter of a million dollars; a successor of Arandia, within the last
few years, is reported to have made $700,000 in a single year; while
another is commonly said to have placed millions to his credit during a
short term of office. Men talk openly in Manila of bribing judges to
put cases off and off. Little wonder, then, that, with such a state of
rottenness, bribery, and corruption obtaining, the missionaries on the
remote stations have, in the interests of the people, looked after
their worldly affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=

<p>The missionary zeal of the Jesuits carried them even to Mindanao, an
island so inaccessible by reason of its mountains and volcanoes, its
impenetrable jungle, its unnavigable rivers infested with alligators
and pirates, its fierce and savage inhabitants always at war with one
another, that the Spanish Government exercised only nominal sovereignty
over it, and was not ever able even to get its interior surveyed. When
the Jesuits came there some years ago they found a Christian population
only on the east and north coasts, and in a few isolated spots of the
other coast regions. Of the interior tribes many were known only by
name. Owing to the zeal of these fathers, not only in missionary
enterprise, but also in geographical and ethnographical exploration,
the network of rivers in the great island is now very well known, the
fathers having recorded the results of their explorations in numerous
sketches and maps. They have also fully described the manners and
customs of the heathen tribes. As an instance of the savagery of the
Mindanayas, for the most part fanatical Moros or Mohammedans, it may be
mentioned that head-hunting seemed till lately to be the great object
of their existence. The man who had chopped off sixty heads was
entitled to wear a scarlet turban for the rest of his mortal life, and
scarlet turbans are still far from uncommon among them. As there was an
inordinate desire among the doughty and dusky warriors to wear these
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>turbans, it follows that the population was being
gradually but surely thinned out. Yet even here, on the sea-coast of
Mindanao, the Jesuits established their stations, living in the midst
of their small flocks, with their lives in their hands, in close
proximity to pirates, savage alligators, and still more savage scarlet
turbans.</p>
<p>The correspondent of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> blames the
missionaries for not teaching the elements of the Christian doctrine in
Spanish to the natives, contrary, as he says, to an express law, of
which they have been continually reminded by the Governor.</p>
<p>The reason, to which he ascribes their conduct is, that they are
afraid that if the people were able to read Spanish books and
newspapers they might come to know too much. Any argument, however
absurd it may be, is evidently good enough, in the eyes of these
writers, for use against priests. They are well enough acquainted with
the ways of the Spanish officialdom to know that that law is a piece of
blatant stupidity, devised by Spanish officials too arrogant or lazy or
indifferent to learn the native languages themselves. Picture to
yourself, if you can, the missionaries scattered over that vast
archipelago, among a people comprising several millions, and speaking
thirty different languages and dialects, attempting to teach the
catechism in Spanish to their flocks. The supposition becomes still
more absurd when we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36"
name="pb36">36</a>]</span>reflect that the Spanish element in the
colony does not exceed eight or nine thousand gathered in and about
Manila and a few other large towns. The missionaries devote themselves
so thoroughly to their flocks, and identify themselves so completely
with them, that instead of being able to teach them Spanish they are in
danger, in some instances, of forgetting it themselves. Wingfield came
across a Dominican missionary who apologized for his bad Spanish, on
the ground that having lived continuously for eighteen years with the
natives, speaking Visaya the whole time, he had almost forgotten his
own tongue. Our experience in Ireland, even at the present time, is
that in Irish-speaking districts, those children who are taught their
catechism in the native tongue, though they may know English, have a
far firmer grasp of the Christian doctrine than those who have been
taught it in English. This fact alone shows the patent absurdity of the
law quoted with such assurance by the correspondent of the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=

considered.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In 1896 we heard of a rising in the remoter parts of
the Philippines. It was represented by the Spanish authorities, who at
the time controlled the news, as of no moment,&mdash;an insurrectionary
movement that they could easily cope with. Yet it continued, and seemed
to wax strong; and, from rumors which began to circulate about the
murdering of monks and friars, we began to feel that the insurrection
was of no ordinary or commonplace nature. It seemed to be directed
against the Church, and to be animated by a deadly spirit of hostility
to the representatives of Religion. It was, of course, impossible at
the time to form an opinion as to the cause of the insurrection, from
the isolated facts which were allowed to come under the notice of the
public. Now, however, the mists have cleared away; and we hope to be
able to prove in the course of this inquiry that the insurrection was a
premeditated and deliberate attack made upon the Church by a native
secret <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>society which was affiliated to, and adopted the
methods of, that type of Freemasonry which gave the Carbonari to Italy
and the Jacobins to France; a type whose disastrous work has been so
much in evidence in South and Central America. It has unfortunately
been busily at work for the last thirty or forty years, indoctrinating
the simple natives of the Philippines with the modern watchwords of
&ldquo;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,&rdquo;&mdash;liberty meaning in
this case, license, anarchy, cruelty, bloodshed; equality, the
confiscation of property; and fraternity, an impious combination
against all opposed to their designs. And foremost amongst these were
undoubtedly from the very first the friars, spiritual guides of nearly
six millions of native Christians, who, in consequence of their
opposition, drew upon themselves the bitter hatred of the members of
the Craft. It thus happened that the friars found themselves denounced
and vilified in Spanish newspapers, in circular letters issued at
Madrid, in speeches at the lodges and clubs, and in the Cortes. The
grossest calumnies the foulest lies, were industriously circulated, to
lower their prestige, and bring about a downfall of that spiritual
power they had justly acquired, and were exercising for the good of
souls. Nothing was known of the struggle in these countries until the
Spanish-American war brought the <span class="corr" id="xd20e613"
title="Source: Philipines">Philippines</span> into prominence before
the English-speaking world. Then the echoes of the struggle began to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>reach our ears. Unfortunately for the friars, the
sympathies of the world were sought, and sought successfully, to be
enlisted on the side of the secret societies, or insurgents, who in
this instance were for the most part one and the same. The news sources
were shrewdly manipulated by astute conspirators to foster their own
purposes; on the Philippine question, world-wide circulation was given
to false and calumnious reports and interviews with leaders of the
insurrection, full of virulent <i>ex parte</i> statements, while no
exposition of views has been sought for from any representative of the
friars. As an instance of the unreliability of these interviews,
circulated through such justly suspected channels, we give the
following. The correspondent of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> sent, a few
months ago, through &ldquo;Reuter&rsquo;s Special Service,&rdquo; an
interview he had with Dr. Nozaleda, the Archbishop of Manila, who, by
the way, is a Dominican. From this interview it would appear that the
Archbishop is opposed to the friars. He is made to say: &ldquo;The
religious Orders must go. That is undeniable, because the whole people
are determined on their abolition, and are now able to render their
retention impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Grace is also made to blame the Orders for causing dissensions,
and thus increasing the disfavor with which they are regarded. The
correspondent adds that he heard privately from a native priest that
the reason the Archbishop hopes for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40"
href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>the expulsion of the religious
Orders is that the friars have grown too strong for him, and that he
expects by getting rid of them to increase his own authority. Now,
apart from the fact that the Archbishop is a member of a religious
Order himself, a fact worth a dozen arguments, we may dismiss the whole
interview as unreliable, since very recently the Archbishop delivered
himself, to a representative of the <i>Chicago Record</i>, of quite
opposite sentiments.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e631width"><img src="images/p040.jpg" alt=

<p class="figureHead">Most Rev. Dr. Nozaleda, O. P.</p>
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Archbishop of Manila.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Mr. Halstead made a special journey to Manila to study the
situation. He was most favorably impressed by the Archbishop, whom he
has undertaken to vindicate before the people of America. One paragraph
from his interview with the Spanish prelate is of special interest at
the present moment: &ldquo;When asked what it was that caused the
insurgents to be so ferocious against the priests, and resolved on
their expulsion or destruction, he said the rebels were at once false,
unjust, and ungrateful. They had been lifted from savagery by Catholic
teachers, who had not only been educators in the schools but teachers
in the fields. The Catholic orders that were singled out for special
punishment had planted in the islands the very industries that were the
sources of prosperity; and the leaders of the insurgents had been
largely educated by the very men whom now they persecuted. Some of the
persecutors had been in Europe, and became revolutionists in the sense
of promoting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>disorder as anarchists. It was the antagonism of
the Church to murderous anarchy that aroused the insurgents of the
Philippines to become the deadly enemies of priests and religious
orders. It was true that in Spain, as in the Philippines, the
anarchists were particularly inflamed against the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prominence was given last year, in some of the English newspapers,
to statements made by a certain Se&ntilde;or S. C. Valdes, a Filipino,
who managed to have an interview sent to the papers, through
&ldquo;Reuter&rsquo;s Special Foreign Agency,&rdquo; that unfortunately
met with a degree of credence on the part of uninformed persons. It is
instructive to analyze some of the statements of this gentleman, and
compare them with statements made for a similar purpose by other
correspondents.</p>
<p>Desiring to prove that the inhabitants of the Philippines are not
naked savages, he says: &ldquo;The inhabitants of the groups of Luzon,
the Viscayas, and the coast of Mindanao are very advanced in their
education. Seventy-five per cent of them can read and write. There are
many native lawyers, doctors, chemists, members of the military and
scientific corps, naval and land architects, merchants, naval officers,
engineers, and also clever and competent secular priests.&rdquo; We
believe Se&ntilde;or Valdes. In spite of what he says a little further
on about numbers of them going abroad for their education, we will
refer our readers to the last <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>chapter, in which we showed that it
is owing to the friars, who have all the primary, secondary, and higher
education in their hands, that the people are so advanced in education;
and as regards the native lawyers and other professional men, we refer
them to the official reports we have given of Manila University, with
its two thousand students, carried on by the Dominicans. As to
Mindanao, what the Jesuits have done there can also be referred to.
Valdes speaks of &ldquo;clever and competent secular priests,&rdquo;
having no word of praise for the religious; and yet the higher
education of the secular clergy is entirely in their hands.</p>
<p>After this eulogium of his own people by Se&ntilde;or Valdes, is it
not curious to find quite an opposite statement, made for party
purposes, by the Manila correspondent of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>?
Wishing to show the incompetence of the friars, he says: &ldquo;The
education of the people is entirely in their hands; it is enough to say
that practically it does not exist.&rdquo; And this of a country in
which seventy-five per cent of the people, according to Se&ntilde;or
Valdes, can read and write, a percentage that would put more than one
European country to the blush.</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Valdes asserts that the friars exercise a tyrannical
power in the islands. He says that they generally consider it an act of
disrespect for the natives to visit them except with bare feet. It is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>curious that Wingfield in his travels never
noticed this, and he had an eagle eye for such deficiencies. Valdes is
not afraid to make the incredible statements that &ldquo;the friars and
the military said that before the reforms should be granted they would
first drown the insurgents in their own blood,&rdquo; and that General
Weyler, when he was captain of the islands, ordered the town of Calumba
to be destroyed, and set fire to, simply to please the Dominicans, who
were anxious to show their power and influence. Proofs, and strong
ones, not mere assertions, are needed when religious men, voluntary
exiles from country and friends for the sake of civilizing rude peoples
and bringing them under the sweet yoke of Christ, are accused of
atrocious cold-bloodedness&mdash;wantonly slaughtering innocent men,
women, and children for the sake of satisfying a sense of vanity!</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that the rebellion in the Philippines
against Spanish rule was not the uprising of a whole people. Of what
account, except for brute force, are some thousands of armed men out of
a peaceful population of eight millions. The insurrectionary movement
was planned, and directed almost exclusively, by the mestizos, or
half-breeds,&mdash;the offspring of the union between native women and
the Chinese, who form a large proportion of the town population, and do
most of the retail trade. We must bear in mind that the leaders had at
their command all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44"
name="pb44">44</a>]</span>the refractory elements of the native
population,&mdash;the banditti, who always existed in large numbers,
and were to be found in force not many miles from Manila, and the
common criminals whom, at the first opportunity, they let loose from
the jails to scour the country. Can we form a judgment of the
sentiments of the Philippine people from the conduct of men who have
treated their prisoners inhumanly, who have burned churches, looted
schools and hospitals, treated ordinary ecclesiastical students with
brutality, and subjected nuns in convents to shameful treatment? We
have plenty of evidence that the natives on the whole are very much
attached to the friars, whom they rescued, when they were able, from
the hands of the rebels, and visited constantly while in captivity,
doing their best to alleviate their sufferings. That they were
peaceably disposed, and loyal to Spain even during the progress of the
rebellion, we may assume from Blumentritt, who said, as late as 1897,
when recounting his experiences as a scientific explorer in these
islands, &ldquo;There are not many colonies where less blood has been
shed, and also not many where the conquered people have so little
hatred of, or dislike to, their conquerors. Already so richly endowed
with the climate and the beauty of their native land, as well as with
the fertility of the soil, the natives of the Philippines are neither
despised nor downtrodden by their rulers, whom they, in their turn, do
not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>dislike. One must, therefore, reckon them among
the happiest in the world.&rdquo; His words, of course, do not apply to
the noisy demagogues, to the Freemasons, to the insurgents, at least to
that part of them who have not been forced into revolt by threats and
terrorism, but they describe the state of the millions as yet untouched
by the rebellion. Se&ntilde;or Valdes and other men of his stamp are
fond of declaring the resolve of the inhabitants of the Philippines
&ldquo;to be free and civilized,&rdquo; and &ldquo;not to be subjected
to the domination of friars or monkish orders.&rdquo; They speak the
sentiments of a small, but very active and noisy, portion of the
population; the overwhelming majority are happy, peaceful, and
contented.</p>
<p>We now come to the painful task of noticing some reckless charges
made by Se&ntilde;or Valdes against the honor of the missionaries, a
painful, yet necessary task, as the accusations were laid before the
public some months ago without comment or contradiction of any kind.
Se&ntilde;or Valdes may think he has scored a point in making such
outrageous statements; but he falls into error if he imagines that what
might be readily swallowed by those who hate religion in Spain and
Portugal would be as readily accepted in England, Ireland, and America.

and the Protestant Alliance, have long since made England familiar with
this gross kind of calumny, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href=
"#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>directed against our own priests and
nuns, repeated, too, year after year, without proof or shadow of
foundation, so recklessly and shamelessly, indeed, that the lecturers
only excite the disgust of the sensible portion of the Protestant body.
Se&ntilde;or Valdes, with unscrupulous audacity, tries to beslime the
character of some of the missionaries, by falsely laying to their
charge the foulest and most unnatural crimes, which for decency&rsquo;s
sake we refrain from detailing. According to this vile traducer the
priests are devoid of all honor and all the moral virtues.</p>
<p>Now, if this were the first time that these atrocious charges were
made, we might say with horror, &ldquo;Can such things be?&rdquo; but
we learn from the memorial presented last April by the heads of the
various religious orders in the Philippines to the Spanish government,
that charges of a similar nature were constantly repeated in Spain
during the previous eighteen months, both in public and in private;
made the subject of speeches in clubs, published in anti-clerical
newspapers&mdash;all part of the campaign against the friars, all done
to lower their prestige in the eyes of the people, and to obtain their
expulsion from the islands. If there were any truth in the charges,
they would have been brought home to the friars long since; names,
dates, and documentary proofs would have been given. A list of
well-proven cases, say twenty or thirty, would have been made up, and
submitted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>to the Government, to whom the Freemasons were
clamoring for their expulsion. But, like the stuff the anti-clerical
lectures nearer home are made of, the charges were always vague,
general, and indefinite. The religious, like men of honor, took no
notice of these calumnies for a long time, hoping that gradually the
storm would blow over; but seeing that it increased day by day, and
that they were being constantly insulted by petty government officials
in the Philippines, they at last took notice of them, amongst other
charges, in their memorial to the Government last April. They asked, as
a matter of right and justice, that names and dates would be given,
that documentary proofs would be produced. They affirmed that the
charges were not made by those who had access to them, and saw them day
by day; that their convents were open to inspection; that the lives of
those living in the country parts were well known to their
parishioners; that in those places they could not act in disguise, as
their Spanish nationality made them conspicuous objects to all eyes.
They asked, in case their innocence were doubted, that proper judicial
proceedings would be instituted.</p>
<p>It has been reserved to an American general to put the last
finishing touch to the lurid picture drawn of the lives of the friars
in the Philippines, by giving wide circulation in the columns of the
<i>New York Herald</i> to a calumny which simply outstrips <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>the
imagination.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e679src" href="#xd20e679" name=
"xd20e679src">1</a> The general guards himself by professing to know
nothing about the matter except from &ldquo;common report,&rdquo;
freely circulated in the Philippines. Now the general, as a man of
honor, might well have allowed these reports to come in by one ear, and
go out by the other; or even if he had kept his mind in suspense, as is
evidently the case, he might have refrained in the meantime from
publishing the &ldquo;common report&rdquo; to the world, knowing how
prone human nature is to fasten on the bad, and to believe in evil
report, though unproven. &ldquo;Every student of Blackstone,&rdquo;
says the general, &ldquo;knows very well what was considered in the
olden time to be the feudal right of the lord over the female vassal
who married on his estate. It may be surprising to many to learn that
the Filipinos allege vehemently that the monastic Orders claim and
exact this feudal right on the marriage of the young Philippine
girls.&rdquo; Common report then, according to the general, charges the
friars with exacting and claiming a right opposed to the fundamental
laws of Christian morality; a right which, if it ever existed in fact,
is at any rate lost in the dim distance of time, and is utterly unknown
to the world at the present day. It is a pity that the ordinary laws of
evidence which are used in dealing with laymen are thrust aside when
dealing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>with priests, and that fanaticism in the latter
case is allowed full play for its imagination. Last April (1898) the
heads of the religious Orders in the Philippines, in their memorial to
the Spanish Government, which by being published both in Spanish and in
French, and circulated widely, was intended as a challenge to the
civilized world, demanded that all gross charges of a like nature
should be investigated by legal means, and that evil-doers should be
punished according to law, if they existed in fact. The challenge as
yet remains unanswered; yet what would have been more easy to prove in
the meantime than such an open and flagrant violation of justice and
morality? If proofs could have been had they would have been gladly
brought forward by the leaders of the rebels, who have been clamoring
for the expulsion of the religious Orders for the last three or four
years, and who are by no means simple and unsophisticated savages, but
men educated enough to be able to conduct newspapers of their own.</p>
<p>With common sense for their guide, let Protestants reflect for a
moment that the Philippines form an integral part of the Catholic
Church, that the religious Orders that are governed by generals in
Rome, that systematic visitations are made, and that the conduct of
every individual is subjected to strict ecclesiastical scrutiny from
time to time. Accordingly, unless they hold that the authorities in
Rome are willing to allow an appalling <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>evil of the kind to go on
without protest, how can they believe that it exists at all?</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case, I can assert without a shadow of doubt,&rdquo;
adds the general, &ldquo;what the <i>Herald&rsquo;s</i> readers have
been previously told by its correspondents&mdash;that the people are
very bitter towards the monks.&rdquo; Whom does he mean by people? Had
the general and the newspaper correspondents come in contact, during
their brief stay in the Philippines, with the six millions of people
till lately under the care of the religious Orders? It is true that
those who have fomented the rebellion, and the thousands who have
joined the insurgent ranks, are bitter towards the monks, or rather
friars. But it is by this time a well-known fact that numbers have been
drawn in through sheer terrorism, and that numbers of others have been
tortured and killed owing to their refusal to join. Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s
late experience on his sugar plantation bears ample witness to this. It
is easy enough for a few thousand desperate and armed men to cow fifty
times their number of peaceful and unarmed tillers of the soil. The
millions, dumb so far, will be found, on closer investigation, to
represent far different feelings towards the friars than the noisy
rebels who, coming in contact with the American troops and
correspondents, profess to represent the feelings of the great body of
the nation.</p>
<p>In direct contradiction to the &ldquo;common report,&rdquo;
circulated by General Meritt, is a testimony to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>virtue
of the Spanish friars in the Philippines, published some years ago
before the present troubles began, by the United States Government in a
consular report. In this report Mr. Frank Karuth, F.R.G.S., who in his
capacity as president of the Philippines&rsquo; Mineral Syndicate had
wide experience with the natives, and came into intimate relations with
the friars in remote provincial stations, writes of the latter as
follows: &ldquo;In these communes or parishes the priest, especially if
he be a Spaniard, as is generally the case, exercises supreme power. He
is the father and counsellor of his people, and helps them not only
with spiritual advice, but also furthers their material interests. The
Spanish priests, friars of strict orders, come to the islands for aye
and good, and with scarcely any exception do their duties faithfully
and devotedly.&rdquo; Is not this testimony, given without any ulterior
party motives, of more value than the evil reports poured into the ears
of newspaper correspondents by the interested leaders of the Philippine
rebels? (See <a href="#app2">Appendix II</a>.)</p>
<p>A few quotations from Protestant travellers who visited the
Philippines before the insurrection had biassed men&rsquo;s minds, and
distorted plain facts, will go a long way in the refutation of these
flippantly uttered and unspeakably gross calumnies. &ldquo;It is
said,&rdquo; observes the wife of the American navigator, Captain
Morrell, &ldquo;that in Manila there are more convents (both of men and
of women) than in any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52"
name="pb52">52</a>]</span>other city in the world of its size; and the
general voice of natives and foreigners declares that they are under
excellent regulations.&rdquo; And then she describes their inmates.
&ldquo;They all seemed full of occupation. There is no idleness in the
convents, as is generally supposed;&rdquo; and this her own account of
the various works accomplished in them sufficiently proves. Moreover,
&ldquo;their devotions begin at the dawn of the day, and are often
repeated during the whole of it, or until late in the evening, in some
form or other. I was born a Protestant, and trust that I shall die a
Protestant; but hereafter I shall have more charity for all who profess
to love religion, whatever may be their creed.&rdquo; Sir John Bowring,
in 1859, speaks of their influence, an influence generally acquired
only by men of holy lives. He says: &ldquo;They exercise an influence
which would seem magical, were it not by their devotees deemed
divine.&rdquo; Dr. Ball, an American Protestant traveller, speaks
highly of the character of the Spanish friars in the Philippines. Of
one whom he met at Manila, he says: &ldquo;He has a fund of knowledge
on almost every subject, speaks six or seven languages, and has
declined an offer of the presidency of the seminary here, preferring to
remain always in the capacity of missionary.&rdquo; Mr. MacMacking,
another Protestant, who spent some years in the islands, says, in 1861:
&ldquo;Most of the priests I came in contact with appeared to be
thoroughly convinced of, and faithful to, their religion in its
purity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After reading these testimonies, we may well open our eyes in
astonishment and wonder at the audacity of those who disseminate these
flagrant lies about a body of men distinguished by learning and
holiness. And yet no one, however holy and devoted his life may be, is
safe from the tongue of the calumniator. Robert Louis Stevenson had to
take up his pen in defence of the heroic martyr of the leper, Father
Damien, vilified by a Protestant minister. Father Damien lived for
years in that place of horrors, Molokai, among the lepers, and died a
martyr of charity; and, while no Protestant minister was to be found
heroic enough to follow his example, one of them, housed in his
comfortable bungalow, and jealous of his fame, made unfounded charges
against him. So is it ever with the world. And above all, nothing need
surprise us in the words and acts of the Philippine insurgents and
their abettors. As an instance of their power of concocting a story to
bring the friars into disrepute, we give the following account of an
attempted poisoning of Aguinaldo by a Spanish prisoner and eleven
Franciscans, taken from the <i lang="es">Republica Filipina</i>, one of
their journals&mdash;telegraphed at great expense to Europe by
&ldquo;Reuter&rsquo;s Special,&rdquo; and inserted in English papers.
The story goes to show that his steward saw a Spanish prisoner, who was
allowed a certain amount of freedom, tampering with a bowl of soup
intended for Aguinaldo. The steward tasted a spoonful of the soup, and
fell dead <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>on the spot. On learning of the affair, the
populace attempted to lynch all the Spanish prisoners, amongst whom
were forty Spanish priests, detained as hostages; but through
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s intervention, they were protected from violence. The
next day at the sitting of the new National Assembly, Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
representative told the story of his narrow escape, and the members
unanimously adopted the chairman&rsquo;s suggestion that they should go
in a body to the president&rsquo;s house and express their sympathy and
congratulations. To crown this farce, a special thanksgiving service
was held in the church at Malolos that evening. The really silly part
of the story is that eleven Franciscan priests, confined as prisoners,
were alleged to have been involved in the conspiracy against
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s life, and it was evidently on this supposition that
all the priests were on the point of being massacred. A few days
afterwards the story was contradicted. After all the fuss and all the
expense of the telegrams, it turned out that the steward did not fall
dead, and that no priests were concerned in the supposed plot. Still
the lie did its work, both in the Philippines and nearer home; for many
heard it, and read about it, who did not see the contradiction.</p>
<p>We are not at present in a position to follow Se&ntilde;or Valdes in
his statements regarding the dissensions between the native and
European friars, the rigorous exactions and tithes, &ldquo;the friars
calling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>themselves owners of the land cultivated by the
natives, claiming rents and tithes which the real owners refused to
pay,&rdquo; but we believe them to be as baseless as his other
accusations. Before he made them, the friars had already, in their
memorial to the Spanish Government, taken notice of similar
accusations, and asked for dates, names, and proofs. It is curious that
no English travellers to these regions have taken notice of these
supposed oppressions on the part of the friars. They are concocted with
the design of expelling the friars from the islands, and confiscating
their property, which they have lawfully acquired, and added to, by
three centuries of industry. It is true they are rich in landed
property, but their riches do not enable them to live individually in
luxury. They are used by the Orders for the purposes of the Orders, in
furthering education, maintaining hospitals, orphanages, and industrial
schools, and in extending their missions not only in the Philippines,
but also in China, Tonkin, Japan, and Formosa. Is it not better, in the
interests of the people, that they should continue in their possessions
than that they should be robbed of them, turned adrift, and their
property divided among needy adventurers? It is a significant fact that
one of the first acts of the National Assembly of the insurgents was to
vote a pension of seventeen thousand dollars to Aguinaldo, enough to
keep several religious communities in existence. These political heroes
are anxious to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>enrich themselves at the expense of others, and to
spend in luxury what has been gathered together through three centuries
of frugal living.</p>
<p>A sample calumny of the kind, to which unbounded circulation has
been given, and its sufficient refutation from an authoritative source,
to which no such reproduction has been extended, may not be out of
place by way of conclusion to our present remarks. Let the candid
reader judge whose words&mdash;the Rev. Mr. Parkhurst&rsquo;s or Father
McKinnon&rsquo;s&mdash;bear the ear-marks of personal investigation and
conscientious endeavor after the truth&mdash;&ldquo;the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These statements of Mr. Parkhurst were clipped from an article in
<i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> (Cleveland, O.); and the clipping was
forwarded to Father McKinnon, who is at present in Manila, and has been
appointed superintentent of all the schools in that city by General
Otis, the commander-in-chief of the American army of occupation. Father
McKinnon was requested to comment upon the extract. The clipping and
the reply are herewith presented.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Rev. M. M. Parkhurst, who has lived in the
Philippines for many years, says that when a couple wish to get married
in the Philippines, they must first pay a fee of &pound;6. or $30, to
the priest, who otherwise will not marry them. As a native rarely earns
more than $5 a month, he seldom has the necessary marriage fee, so that
common law marriages <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57"
name="pb57">57</a>]</span>are the frequent result. The baptismal fee,
he says, is $25, and the death fee is $60 for an adult, and $10 for an
infant. A poll-tax of $25 for each man, and $15 for each woman, is
collected; and when a man builds a house, he must pay $10 for having a
chimney blessed.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>To this Father McKinnon replies:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Responding to your favor with regard to
quotation from the Rev. M. M. Parkhurst, I may say it is a lie from top
to finish. I have been here now nearly six months, and have studied the
religious question very carefully, and, I think, without prejudice. To
do this I had every opportunity, not only here in Manila, but also in
the outlying provinces, as I have been sent frequently into the
interior of the island to treat with the insurgent leaders. I have
conversed with all classes of people, and I think I know pretty well
just how matters stand. This statement of Mr. Parkhurst is in keeping
with all the other statements made by irresponsible preachers
concerning the condition of the Church here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage here is like marriage any place else. If the parties
are able to do so, they are supposed to pay something. If not able to
pay, the priests here marry them gratis, just as you or I or any other
minister of the Gospel would do in America. For rich or poor there is
no fixed fee; that is left entirely to the contracting parties. For
baptisms and deaths the rule is the same. Indeed, for baptisms, the
priest rarely receives more than one dollar, and more often he receives
nothing at all. For deaths they go even further than we do in America,
as every parish church keeps a supply of coffins on hand to give gratis
to those who are too poor to employ an undertaker. For the grandest
funeral here no more than $25 is paid, which would be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>equal to
$12 of our money. Even the fee of $2.50, charged for marriage license
reverts not to the Church or Government, but to the orphan asylums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of orphan asylums, the Girls&rsquo; Asylum here
gives a dowry of $500 to every inmate upon her marriage. This is but a
sample of what is done in the way of charity here. We hear great tales
of the wealth of the monks, and inquire about the property, and find it
is a large estate, the income of which is used to support some
hospital, or other charitable institution under the care of said monks.
Nowhere in the world is charity in greater evidence than here. The
magnificent hospitals and orphanages, schools of industry, etc., would
be a credit to any nation. The amount expended thus every year is
enormous. The monks individually are as poor as the proverbial church
mouse. The islands have a population of over 8,000,000 Catholics. The
priests number about 1,500; and considering the weakness of human
nature, and the fact that many of them live alone out in the wilds far
away from brother priests, it is not surprising that an occasional one
falls. Even among the saintly (?) Parkhurst&rsquo;s brethren, I have
heard of an occasional fall in civilized America. But here these are
the exceptions. The main body of the clergy are good, holy men. The
Archbishop is a man who would be an honor to any church in any country.
He is a man of eminent learning and great sanctity. He is one of the
kindest and most charitable men I ever met. Go to his house at whatever
hour you will, and you will find it crowded with poor. For each he has
a kind word and some substantial aid. Every cent he receives is given
away in this manner. His personal magnetism is such that to meet him is
to admire him. If I wished to use names I could give you many striking
examples of this. In our army and navy we had some <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>Parkhursts who were ready to believe or say
anything about his Grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For those whom I thought worth convincing that they were
wrong, I arranged that at different times they should meet him. The
result was the same in every case. Each would come away feeling that
his Grace was a much maligned man. To-day, among the American officials
in both army and navy, no man is more respected than the Archbishop of
Manila. In my estimation, there are two reasons for the impression
which has gone abroad concerning the Church here. Aguinaldo, knowing in
his cunning that there were many Parkhursts in America, thought lying
about the Church would be an excellent way to gain the sympathy of
Americans. I have been all over the country, and find no poverty
anywhere. For Indians I find them remarkably well instructed. The one
who cannot read and write is an exception. There are public schools
supported by the Government all over the country. Had Mr. Parkhurst
desired to learn the truth, he could have done so from his brother
ministers, who are chaplains here. I think they would have told him the
truth, as I have found them to be a nice gentlemanly lot of men, ever
ready to do me a kindness. Some of them I admire very much for their
devotion to the sick and those in need.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Secret societies, and, above all, that great guild
known as Freemasonry, are certainly foremost, if not controlling,
factors in the warfare made upon throne and altar during the last one
hundred and fifty years.</p>
<p>In saying this we do not intend to express any opinion for or
against the sentiments of Protestant Freemasons in England and the
United States, numbers of whom, no doubt, reprobate the anti-Christian
spirit this association shows on the Continent and in Spanish America.
They have been brought up to regard it as a perfectly harmless and
beneficent institution, and cannot understand the attitude taken with
regard to it by the Catholic Church.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Collection of seals and stamps used by various
branches of the &ldquo;Katipunan,&rdquo; the secret society of the
natives.</p>
</div>
<p>It is quite true that Freemasonry may have in these countries kept
to its original constitution, which, we may admit, was of a beneficent
nature. But what Catholic writers on the subject urgently insist upon
is, that on the Continent it very soon <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>assumed a political and
dangerous character. For a long time it was not condemned by the
Church, and many good Catholics of rank and position gave their names
to it. It was only when its dangerous tendencies came to light that it
received solemn ecclesiastical condemnation, and that Catholics were
forbidden to join it. For more than a century this secret guild has
been at the bottom of the revolutions that have desolated the modern
world. Some years previous to the French Revolution, German envoys of
the Society of the Illuminati advised the French Masons to form a
political committee in each lodge; and in time, as Robison remarks,
these committees led to the formation of the Jacobin Club. &ldquo;Thus
were the lodges of France,&rdquo; says this writer, &ldquo;converted in
a very short time into a set of affiliated secret societies,
corresponding with the mother lodges of Paris, receiving from thence
their principles and instructions, and ready to rise up at once when
called upon to carry on the great work of overturning the State. Hence
it arose that the French aimed, in the very beginning, at subverting
the whole world. Hence, too, may be explained how the revolution took
place almost in a moment in every part of France. The revolutionary
societies were early formed, and were working in secret before the
opening of the National Assembly; and the whole nation changed, and
changed again and again, as if by beat of drum.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Spain, since its introduction it assumed a sanguinary and
virulent character; it brought about revolutions and civil wars,
embittered classes against one another, wronged and starved the clergy,
robbed, turned adrift, and banished the religious Orders.</p>
<p>There is, indeed, a good deal of difficulty in tracing all these
evils to the action of the Freemasons; for on the Continent, especially
in Spain, the society has been always of a more secret nature than in
these countries. Members of the Craft in England and the United States
are generally well known to belong to it; their halls and lodges in the
larger towns are imposing and conspicuous; their emblems and badges are
often seen in the light of day. But on the Continent we see very little
of all this; it is a thoroughly secret society; the members and their
movements are carefully veiled from sight. As we said before,
Freemasonry, on its introduction to the Continent, at once assumed a
political character. The Deists and free-thinkers of the last century
utilized it as a potent means of combining against the Church, and of
carrying on their evil propaganda. In this way they were aided by the
Jansenists, with different motives it is true, but still, when it was a
question of opposing the religious Orders, with a whole heart. The
working of the society in Spain in this century has necessarily been
more stealthy and insidious than in France, for there it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>was face
to face with a truly Catholic population devotedly attached to the
Church.</p>
<p>By means of atheistical French literature, the works of Voltaire and
other unbelievers, translated into Spanish, brought across the border
in large bales, and disseminated through the Peninsula, the Freemasons
had already indoctrinated a large number of active and restless spirits
with revolutionary and anti-Christian ideas, when the troubles and
civil war of 1834 gave them the opportunity they desired of making an
onslaught on the religious Orders. At such times the minds of men are
in a ferment, and the most incredible reports may be spread abroad, and
will be implicitly believed by the populace. Accordingly, on the awful
visitation of cholera, which swept over Europe at that time, desolating
cities and towns, and leaving thousands upon thousands of families in
mourning, in Madrid the report was industriously spread by the Masons
that the Monks and Friars had poisoned the wells, and were the cause of
the sickness among the people. In a mad fit of rage the populace rose
on all sides, rushed to the convents and monasteries, and murdered all
the inmates they could lay their hands upon. This awful event is
referred to in the Memorial.</p>
<p>Such a state of things may seem hardly possible in the nineteenth
century; and yet a similar catastrophe nearly happened in Lisbon a few
years ago, the circumstances of which were related to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>writer
by one of the Dominicans who was living there at the time. It appears
that the Dominican nuns had opened a dispensary for the relief of the
poor. Strange to say, the frightful report soon went abroad that the
nuns were stealing children, and killing and boiling them down to make
a healing ointment out of their remains. The city was in an uproar; it
was unsafe for priests and nuns to be seen in the streets; and the
populace who really believed the absurd story, being in a furious state
of excitement, were on the point of burning down the convent, and
maltreating the nuns.</p>
<p>To return to Spain, the popular rising in Madrid was utilized by the
revolutionary party in carrying out, the following year, the
suppression of all the convents and monasteries in the country. The
religious were driven out into the world; and their lands, goods,
libraries, and art-treasures were sold for the benefit of the public
debt, and to supply means to carry on the civil war. The bishops and
secular clergy as well were also robbed, numerous episcopal sees were
suppressed, and the goods of the Church declared to be national
property. The Freemason Government promised to look after the interests
of the Church by paying salaries to all ecclesiastics. As a result,
Spain was filled, in a few years, with a poverty-stricken and starving
clergy, and ruined churches and mouldering abbeys were to be seen on
all sides. The effects of that great spoliation are still felt in the
Peninsula; for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>though the religious Orders have revived in the
meantime, and numerous convents and monasteries have been built, the
priests are not in sufficient numbers for the needs of the population,
which thereby, in many places, is suffering great spiritual
destitution.</p>
<p>The policy of robbery and confiscation was boldly advocated for the
Philippines, just before the late war, in one of the leading reviews of
Madrid. Juan Ferrando Gomez, in a series of articles<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e791src" href="#xd20e791" name="xd20e791src">1</a> bitterly
hostile to the Philippine Friars, proposed their entire suppression.
They should be turned out of their convents and missionary houses by a
secret decree, of which they were to be kept in ignorance till the
execution actually took place. Their convents in Manila would be useful
as barracks and Government offices, their country estates could be
divided amongst their tenants, and the rents formerly paid to the
Friars could be commuted into a tax to be paid to the State. Moreover,
the Archbishop of Manila, and any others of the bishops belonging to
the religious Orders, should be forced out of the country. Besides
that, the schools and university belonging to the Friars should also be
either suppressed, or taken out of their hands. Reading these
flagrantly unjust proposals in the light of recent Spanish history, and
with the help of the Memorial, we are <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>inclined to believe that,
without much further pressure from the Freemasons, the Spanish Ministry
would have carried them out. Fortunately for the Friars, as well as the
natives, they have no voice in the matter now. Under the American flag
the religious will be treated as citizens, having the common right of
citizens, neither to be molested in their persons nor robbed of their
property. The President of the United States has declared this in clear
terms to the Holy See.</p>
<p>With regard to Freemasonry in Spanish or Latin America, the Rev.
Reuben Parsons has recently written on the subject (see <a href=
"#app3">Appendix III</a>.), substantiating all his assertions by
quotations from Masonic organs or other unprejudiced sources, and
clearly exposing the systematic war which the lodges in South and
Central America have carried on against religion. He shows how it has
started revolutions, assassinated the leaders of the people, exiled the
clergy, and persecuted the Church in other ways.</p>
<p>We will now endeavor to trace the history of Freemasonry in the
Philippines and its connection with the insurrection there. In the
Philippines Freemasonry found itself face to face with a simple native
population, mostly Christian, and an active body of Spanish
missionaries belonging to various religious Orders, loyal to their
native country, possessing unbounded influence over their flocks, and
rapidly bringing under the yoke of Christ the tribes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>who were
still Pagan. The religious were a power that they could not hope to
cope with for a long time; and so at first they were left unmolested,
while the members of the Craft were gathering converts, and
strengthening their position, among a class more suitable to their
nefarious designs, viz., the mestizos, or half-breeds; the Filipinos,
or those who, though born in the country, consider themselves the
pure-blooded descendants of the early colonists; and the Spanish
officials, numbers of whom were already Masons before they went to the
Archipelago.</p>
<p>That the Freemasonry in the Philippines has shown itself of a
distinctly sanguinary nature is not to be wondered at when we consider
its close connection with Spain. The Lodge of Action, or Red Lodge,
composed of determined revolutionists ready to use the dagger, and
prepared to wade through a sea of blood to accomplish their designs,
represented by Mazzini and the Carbonari in Italy, has a large
following in Spain, and was presided over, a few years ago, by Zorilla,
the Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Spain.</p>
<p>The following account of the growth of Freemasonry in the
Philippines, taken from the <i>Rosario</i>, an organ published in Rome,
the editor of which has access to special information, and is in close
touch with friars who have been living for many years in the
archipelago as missionaries, will be of profound interest. In or about
1860 many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>of the strangers who frequented the Philippines
were Freemasons, and members of the lodges of Singapore, Hongkong,
Java, Macao, and the open ports of China. This was at a period when
England, Holland, France, the United States, for colonial reasons of
their own, showed hostility to Spain. It was therefore quite natural
that, in those lodges, an anti-Spanish spirit gradually arose in the
Philippines. Seeing this spirit arising, two officials of the Spanish
navy, Malcampo and Mendez Nunez, Freemasons themselves, determined to
oppose Freemasonry to Freemasonry, by founding lodges that would uphold
the Spanish interests; they therefore established, at Cavite, the Lodge
Primera Luz Filippina, placing it under the Grand Orient of Lusitania,
and a little afterwards another lodge at Zamboanga, for the officials,
seamen, and civil functionaries who held positions in Mindanao.</p>
<p>In opposition to these, the strangers residing in the Philippines
established at Manila itself a lodge of the Scottish rite, as a
<i>point d&rsquo;appui</i> for the enemies of Spain. They thus moved
the centre of conspiracy against Spain to the islands themselves, and
tried to draw the natives into their nets by giving them important
positions in the Craft. The two opposing factions of Freemasonry also
increased their numbers largely by taking in the political exiles who
were sent to the Philippines as a result of the part taken by them in
the various <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>civil wars in the Peninsula, most of whom gave
their names and services to one or the other. It is remarkable that
these two bodies, guided by opposite political principles, one
depending on a Spanish centre and directed principally by Spaniards,
the other directed principally by Germans, English, and Americans, and
opposed to Spanish interests, found, at least in one direction, a point
of concord, namely, in opposition to the religious Orders. Although the
Spanish Masons were actuated by a love for their mother-country, still
the well-known anti-clericalism of Freemasonry prevailed over every
other consideration, blinding them to the fact that the best and most
influential representatives of Spain in the Philippines were to be
found in the religious Orders, who were the only civilizing force able
to deal with the natives. They thus indirectly paved the way for the
insurrection; for it is well known that from the ranks of the opposing
factions, and principally by reason of their anti-clerical tendencies,
arose the sanguinary society of the &ldquo;Katipunan,&rdquo; which made
it its direct aim to expel the friars, and overturn the Spanish
government in the islands. The <i>Grand Orient</i>, the organ of this
society, declared that one of the first articles of its programme was
the extermination of the religious. And here it may be noticed that the
ninth term of the proposals made by the insurgents to America was as
follows: &ldquo;There shall be a general religious toleration; but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>measures shall be adopted for the abolition and
expulsion of the religious communities, who, with an iron hand, have
hitherto demoralized the actual civil administration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime the lodges increased in number, so much so that two
years ago there were at Manila sixteen lodges affiliated to the Grand
Orient of Spain, and one at least in every pueblo in the province of
Luzon, and also lodges in Zamboanga and the Visaya Islands; an
Anglo-German club-lodge, on the books of which were inscribed the names
of a great part of the Government officials; also the German Union,
affiliated to the Grand Orient of Berlin; the society of S. Giovanni
del Monte, a centre common to Swiss, French, Belgian, and Dutch Masons.
In all, according to reliable statistics, there were a hundred lodges
and 25,000 initiates. When the Freemasonry of the Philippines had
gathered these numbers under its banner, the insurrection broke out;
and of its 25,000 members, at least 20,000 were to be found in the
ranks of the rebels. Could any clearer proof than this be found that
the insurrection in the Philippines is the direct work of
Freemasonry?</p>
<p>We will here call the attention of our readers to two of the
illustrations. The first is a collection of various seals and stamps,
forty-one in number, in use by the various branches of the Katipunan,
the sanguinary secret society of the natives. Masonic emblems, the
compass and rule, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71"
name="pb71">71</a>]</span>triangle, the keys, etc., are to be found on
almost all of them, proving beyond doubt the Masonic direction and
constitution of the society. Turn now to the other
illustration,&mdash;a Masonic apron, worn at secret meetings and also
in battle, which was found on the body of an insurgent after an
engagement. No concealment here of methods to be used,&mdash;the head
dripping with blood, one hand grasping the bleeding head, and the other
holding the dagger, sufficiently attest to all beholders the work of
the Red Lodge.</p>
<p>The position of the religious Orders in the Philippines, just before
the war broke out between Spain and America, had become so perilous and
unbearable, that they addressed a long Memorial to the Spanish
Government, exposing their grievances, explaining the cause of the
rebellion, and suggesting remedies suitable for the situation.</p>
<p>This Memorial is more than a mere appeal to the Spanish Government.
It is a challenge to the civilized world, made by men whose dignity and
honor have been outraged by awful and unjust charges levelled at them
by their foes, and spread far and near by the press. The Memorial has
been put into print by the Friars, and scattered through Spain; it has
been translated into French, and now it appears (in a condensed form)
in an English dress. Up to the present, at any rate, it has not drawn
forth an answer from those whose calumnies were the cause of its
appearance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>From another point of view it is of interest,
giving us valuable information as to the causes of the rebellion, and
incidentally throwing a lurid light upon the dark places and dark
workings of Freemasonry. Its importance as an authoritative exposition
lies in the fact that it emanates from the combined heads of all the
religious Orders in the Philippines, men having under their spiritual
care more than five out of the six millions of Christians in the
country. It is signed by Father Manuel Gutierrez, Provincial of the
Augustinians; Father Gilberto Martin, Commissary-Provincial of the
Franciscans; Father Francisco Ajarro, Provincial of the Recollects;
Father Candido Garcia Valles, Vicar-Provincial of the Dominicans; Pio
Pi, S. J., Superior of the Missions of the Society of Jesus.</p>

</div>
<p>We doubt whether any official notice was taken of the document by
the Spanish Government. It was on its way to Spain when, on the
declaration of war by America, Admiral Dewey stole into Manila Bay by
night, shattered the Spanish fleet the next morning at Cavite, and laid
siege to Manila. In the meantime, too, the Spanish Ministry had
resigned; and when the documents arrived at its destination, a new
Ministry was in office, under Se&ntilde;or Sagasta, with a new colonial
minister. Facing bravely, but ineffectually, one of the greatest powers
in the world, the new Ministry was entirely taken up with cares and
interests <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>on which depended the existence of Spain as a
nation.</p>
<p>A striking characteristic of the memorial is its outspoken
insistence upon Freemasonry as the principal cause of the Rebellion, a
position not unwarranted in view of the evidence presented on previous
pages. So much has been heard from the opponents of the religious
Orders, that a word from themselves, in their own defence, will have
all the air of novelty. We reprint the memorial, quite confident that
it will not suffer by comparison with what has appeared from the other
side.</p>
<p>The Memorial of the Philippine Friars to the Spanish Government,
April, 1898.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE COLONIAL MINISTER.</p>
<p>In addition to the telegram sent to His Excellency, the
Governor-General and Viceroy, on the first of this month, that he might
bring it officially under your Excellency&rsquo;s notice, which the
said authority informs us has been done, we, the Superiors of the
Congregations of the Augustinians, Franciscans, Recollects, Dominicans,
and Jesuits, have the honor of presenting this Statement to his
Majesty, King Alfonso XIII., and, in his royal name, to Her Majesty the
Queen Regent, Dona Maria Christina, to the President and Members of the
Crown Ministerial Council, and more especially to your Excellency as
Colonial Minister. We address this Statement directly to your
Excellency, according to law and custom, that you may deign to bring it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>under the notice of the exalted personages already
mentioned, and even if it appears desirable before the nation, duly
assembled in the Cortes of the kingdom.</p>
<p>The time has come for us faithful and constant upholders of Spanish
rule in the Philippines to break our traditional silence. The hour has
also come to defend our honor, which has been so much assailed, and our
holy and patriotic ministry, which has been the object of the most
terrible and unjustifiable accusations and calumnies.</p>
<p>We have borne patiently with the Freemasons and insurgents, known
and unknown, who in their newspapers, clubs, and public meetings, have
for the last eighteen months insulted and vilified us, accusing us,
among other things, of having fostered the rebellion. We have
discovered to our sorrow that a number of Spaniards, having resided in
these islands for a longer or shorter period as the case might be, on
their return to the Peninsula have spoken of us in terms which they
would not have dared to employ if in place of being priests and friars
we had been laymen, or if instead of being ecclesiastical congregations
we had belonged to civil or military bodies.</p>
<p>The religious of the Philippines, far away from Europe, alone in
their ministry, scattered to the furthermost corners of the
Archipelago, and without any other companions and witnesses of their
labors than their own dear and simple parishioners, have no other
defence save right and reason. Conscious that we have always been loyal
and patriotic subjects, and have always fulfilled our duties and the
obligations to our holy ministry, we have borne patiently and silently,
according to the advice of the Apostle, insults and calumnies from the
very persons to whom we had offered our services in all Christian
sincerity. We have kept silence under insults from persons calling
themselves forsooth Catholics, but who are infected with the practical
Jansenism <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>of certain latter-day reformers. We even suffered
in silence certain false information, most dishonoring to the religious
Orders, to be brought before the Cortes last year. It was asserted, not
only in private, but in important, centres, that the prestige of the
religious Orders in the Philippines was so shaken that it would be
necessary to drive them out by armed force. It was also declared, as
most dishonoring to a great nation like Spain, to have commissioned
friars to furnish information about the Philippines, and to have asked
their advice in the form of a memorial presented to the Senate. In
addition to all this, the gravest accusations, some directed against a
worthy prelate, were brought against us, veiled, however, under the
guise of impartiality and gentle correction. Before long the clamors
will be renewed in a different tone; and we shall see the reproduction
in the Archipelago, with more or less cruelty, of that historical
period in the Peninsula of 1834&ndash;1840.</p>
<p>REASONS FOR OUR SILENCE TILL THE PRESENT TIME.</p>
<p>We believed that a wise and prolonged silence, added to that
prudence and magnanimity which should always distinguish religious
orders, would have sufficed for good and discreet persons, and that
they would have repelled the accusations, and formed a judgment that
would be proof against these repeated attacks. But, instead of calming
down, the storm appears to increase daily. The Treaty of Biac-na-Bato
has furnished to many the opportunity of renewing the crafty
insinuation, nay, bold affirmation, already made by the rebel chiefs,
that the religious institutes were the sole cause of the insurrection.
One of the chiefs of the &ldquo;Katipunan&rdquo; secret society has
declared in his paper, The <i>Grand Orient</i>, which, like a plague,
is still scattered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"
name="pb76">76</a>]</span>over the islands, that one of the first
articles in his programme is the expulsion of the religious Orders. In
the Peninsula as well as here, the Freemasons and others who second
their efforts have recommenced the war against us. They have published
manifestoes at Madrid, in which, misusing the name of the Philippine
natives, they demand vexatious and disgraceful measures against the
clergy.</p>
<p>If under these circumstances we still remained silent, our silence
would be attributed, and rightly so, to fear or to guilt. Our patience
would be called weakness; and even sensible and solid Catholics, who
recognize the injustice of the attacks made against us, might be led to
believe that we were really stained with guilt, or that we had fallen
into such a state of moral prostration, that we could be ill-treated
with impunity.</p>
<p>THE RELIGIOUS ORDERS PERSECUTED BECAUSE THEY UPHOLD RELIGION.</p>
<p>On what grounds are the religious bodies persecuted? Simply because
they uphold true and sound doctrine, and have never shown a weak front
to the enemies of God and of their country. If we had shown ourselves
pusillanimous in sight of the works of Masonic lodges, and in presence
of the propagation of the politico-religious errors imported from
Europe; if we had given the faintest mark, not of sympathy, but even of
toleration, to the men who were scattering broadcast false notions of
liberty condemned by the Church; if patriotism had cooled in our
hearts, or if the innovators had not found in each Philippine religious
an intractable and terrible adversary to their plans,&mdash;the
religious congregations would never have been disturbed. On the
contrary, we should have been extolled to the skies, the more so
because our enemies do not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href=
"#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>ignore the fact that, were we to help
them in the Archipelago, were we to give them our support, or at least
were we to remain silent, we should thereby give them an undisputed
victory.</p>
<p>But they know well that our standard is no other than the Syllabus
of the great Pontiff, Pius IX., so frequently confirmed by Leo XIII.,
wherein all rebellion against the powers is so energetically condemned.
Yea! truly they hate us, and under different names and on divers
pretexts they are making such a cruel war upon us that it would seem as
if the Freemasons and Revolutionists had no other enemies in the
Philippines than the religious bodies.</p>
<p>THE RELIGIOUS PERSECUTED AS LOYAL SPANIARDS.</p>
<p>Apart from their essentially religious character, the regular clergy
of the Archipelago are the sole Spanish institution, permanent and
deeply-rooted, which exists in the islands&mdash;a vigorous
organization well adapted to these regions. While the civil and
military officials on the one hand, who come from Spain, live here only
for a time, fulfilling their duties more or less wisely according as it
is for or against their private interests, and yet are ignorant of the
languages of the country, and have only a superficial intercourse with
the Islanders, we, the religious, come over here to sacrifice our whole
existences, dispersed often one by one amongst the remotest tribes.
When we bid an eternal farewell to our native shores, we voluntarily
condemn ourselves, by virtue of our vows, to live forever devoted to
the moral, religious, and civil education of <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e894" title="Source: the the">the</span> natives; and we have
waged many conflicts in their behalf. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>CRAFTINESS OF THE INSURGENT CHIEFS.</p>
<p>Seeing that we were the most deeply rooted, influential, and
best-respected Spaniards in the country, and that we would come to no
terms with them or their projects, the rebel chiefs determined to
demand our expulsion from the Government. They were aware that they
would be backed up in their demand by many among the Spanish residents
in the Archipelago, who, led by passion and ignorance, lend a willing
ear to all who declaim against the religious Orders, especially when
the watchwords used are &ldquo;Free Thought,&rdquo; &ldquo;Liberty of
the Press,&rdquo; &ldquo;Secularization of Education,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ecclesiastical Liquidation,&rdquo; &ldquo;Suppression of the
Privileges of the Clergy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the password among the rebels became, especially since the
Treaty of Biac-na-Bato, the emancipation of their country. They
declared they had no dislike to Spanish administration, nor any
intention of separation from Spain; what made them rise in rebellion
were the abuses of the clergy, and their only demand was the expulsion
of the religious Orders. But these were lying declarations, as numerous
judicial and non-judicial documents containing the plans of the
conspirators have proved. They made these false professions because
they knew that if they declared that the insurrection was brought about
by the numerous abuses of power which have been committed by civil and
military functionaries, they would have all the Spanish element in the
Archipelago leagued against them, and would have the door closed to all
their means of propaganda.</p>
<p>ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE RELIGIOUS ORDERS.</p>
<p>We ask, in the first place, where are these abuses which are always
the subject of their declamations in the clubs <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>and
lodges? We preach the Gospel, and not only do we draw to a civilized
life the barbarous tribes of the Archipelago, whom we have preserved
peaceful and happy for three centuries, as the whole world knows, but
we have always been the defenders of the natives, who are subjected to
a thousand vexations on the part of the Spanish lay residents. At all
times we have watched over the purity of the Faith and the preservation
of good morals, showing ourselves inflexible against illegal exactions,
immoral games, and those who lead scandalous lives. After all that has
been written against us for so many years, we defy our calumniators,
and do not fear an honest and impartial examination of our lives and
works. Let those who murmur and speak against us, prove by exact dates
and authentic documents that their accusations are well founded.</p>
<p>They say we are enemies of education and of the diffusion of
knowledge; if by education they mean the teaching of doctrine condemned
by the Church, we are at one with them; but there is no education in
the ordinary sense of the term, primary, secondary, or superior, in the
islands that has not been founded, encouraged, and sustained by the
clergy. It is well known that very few of the native officials who went
through their course in our schools have taken part in the rebellion;
and the proclaimers of &ldquo;Free-thought&rdquo; are, for the most
part, individuals who failed in their career, and were the refuse of
our classes.</p>
<p>As to the accusations of immorality which are recklessly levelled
against us, all we have to say is that everyone can see our monasteries
and convents and ourselves, and can form a judgment on our lives; the
parish priests and missionaries are alone, surrounded by a multitude of
natives; everyone can see what we are doing, and hear what we are
saying; our European figures and sacerdotal character <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>bring us
into such prominence before the people that it would be stupid to
imagine that we could hide our doings.</p>
<p>We consider, as not worthy of reply, the impudent assertion that in
the country parts we are despots; that in a thousand ways we suck the
blood of our tenants; charges often before refuted by the most explicit
documentary evidence. Neither is it worth while speaking of the
abominable calumny of attributing to us the passage through the country
with armed force, and the imprisoning and torturing of those implicated
in the first revolt. All this is part of the absurd fable that we are
absolute masters, not only of the consciences of the people, but of the
Archipelago itself; statements contradicted by the very men who make
them, when they declare in the Cortes that we have lost all influence
and all prestige in the islands.</p>
<p>CAUSE OF THE REBELLION.</p>
<p>The utter want of religion to be found among a great number of the
Spanish residents, the facility with which the ancient laws of the
Archipelago were changed, the instability of the public functionaries,
a fruitful source of abuses, contributed for several years to discredit
the Spanish name. But Freemasonry, as the world knows, has been the
principal cause of the social disorganization of the Philippines. The
Hispano-Philippine Association of Madrid was Masonic; the Masons were
almost alone in the work of urging on the natives to make war on the
clergy and the Spanish residents; they authorized the founding of
lodges in the Archipelago. It was the Masons, too, who formed the
&ldquo;Katipunan&rdquo; society, so essentially Masonic that in the
terrible &ldquo;compact of blood&rdquo; they make, they are actually
imitating the Carbonari of Italy.</p>
<p>In consequence of the teaching of the Freemasons, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>voice of
the parish priest has no longer any effect on numbers of the natives,
especially at Manila and in the neighboring provinces, where they are
accustomed to give themselves airs of importance and independence; and
the prestige of the Spanish name has grown considerably less, and
disappeared entirely in many places. What wonder, then, if the powerful
instincts of race awoke, and that, pondering on the fact that they had
a language and climate and territory of their own, the rebels should
try to build a wall of separation between the Spaniards and the Malays?
Is it not natural that having been brought to believe that the friar is
neither their father nor the pastor of their souls, nor their friend
and enthusiastic defender, but, on the contrary, a spoiler, and that
the Spanish resident is only a money-grubber, having more or less power
and authority, they should have desired to free themselves from the
Spanish authority?</p>
<p>Six months ago the &ldquo;Katipunan&rdquo; society was limited to
the mountains of Langua and Bulacan, where the rebel chiefs had taken
refuge, and also counted some adherents among certain tribes in touch
with the insurgents. But now the plague is widespread; the insurgents
violating the promise made to the gallant Marquis of Estella, and at
the call of a secret signal, have scattered themselves over the central
provinces, and by means of cruelty and terrorism have succeeded in
enrolling in their ranks a great number of natives who after the
submission at Biac-na-Bato gave pledges of fidelity to Spain. They have
also succeeded in intrenching themselves at Capiz and in other parts of
the Viscayas. The rising in Zambaies, Pagasinan, Iloco, and Cebu are
all of recent origin; and the same may be said of the
&ldquo;Katipunans&rdquo; discovered at Manila.</p>
<p>However, the greater part of the country is not yet perverted; a
wave of hallucination and fanaticism has passed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>over it,
but the heart of the people is still sound, and with careful management
they will return to their usual habits of peace and submission. The
move wealthy classes are also sound, and are against the rebellion.</p>
<p>We frankly tell the Government that if it does not aid the Church,
the revolutionary movement will increase every day, and it will be
morally impossible for the religious to remain here any longer. What
good is it for us to do our duty to the people when others are allowed
to undo our work at the same time? Of what use is it for us to teach
the people to be docile and submissive when their worst passions are
excited by others, who tell them to make nothing of our teaching? What
professor could teach successfully if his pupils were met outside the
classroom by respectable persons who told them to despise his lessons?
The civil authority, according to the teaching of the Church, ought as
far as possible to be a bulwark to religion and morality. If the
Government, therefore, does not protect us from the avalanche of
insults hurled against us; if it does not root out the secret
societies; if it allows our sacerdotal character to be trodden under
foot while our enemies destroy the fruit of our labors,&mdash;we regret
to say that we cannot continue our ministry in the islands.</p>
<p>Spain has bound herself very stringently to obligations of this
nature. One of the laws of the Code of the Indies says expressly on
this point: &ldquo;We command the Viceroys, the Presidents, the
Auditors, the Governors, and the other functionaries of the Indies, to
favor, and aid, and encourage the religions orders who are occupying
themselves in the conversion of the natives to our entire
satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spirit that moved Philip II. was seen in the answer he made to
those who advised him to abandon the Archipelago, in view of the little
revenue they brought to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href=
"#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>Crown. He said: &ldquo;For the
conversion of only one of the souls that are there I would willingly
give all the treasures of the Indies, and if they were not enough I
would add those of Spain. Nothing in the world would make me consent to
cease sending preachers and ministers of the Gospel to all the
provinces that have been discovered, even if they are barren and
sterile, for the Holy Apostolic See has given to us and our heirs the
apostolic commission of publishing and preaching the Gospel. The Gospel
can be spread through these islands, and the natives can be drawn from
the worship of the demon by making known to them the true God, in a
spirit alien to that of temporal greed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>UNJUST CONTEMPT SHOWN TOWARDS THE RELIGIOUS ORDERS IN THE
PHILIPPINES.</p>
<p>An idea has spread since the Revolution in Spain of 1868 that the
Philippine Friars are a necessary evil, an out-of-date institution
which has to be kept up for reasons of state. This unworthy idea,
manifested sometimes with frankness, sometimes with a certain
reticence, and which wounds us to the quick, has been constantly
brought forward by our enemies. The natives who have been to Spain are
fully aware of it; without leaving the Philippines, a great number of
natives have observed it, and are at present trying to propagate it in
the Archipelago. Very numerous, too are the Spanish residents who are
hostile to us, owing to an anti-clerical spirit or to jealousy; in
fact, we have enemies in all classes of society.</p>
<p>Many people, in consequence, think that our very existence in the
country is simply owing to pity and condescension on the part of the
Government; that we are merely tolerated, and are of less value in the
eyes of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>civil authorities than the members of any lay
profession. With a marvellous facility all the evils that affect the
country are laid at our door; and every time a governor makes a gross
blunder in dealing with the natives, the evil consequences which flow
from it are put down to us. Now, every class of society has a right to
ordinary respect and fair treatment; we receive neither one nor the
other, but are treated with absolute contempt. This humiliating
situation, as individuals obliged to greater perfection than other
Christians, we patiently bear with; but as religious orders we cannot
put up with it any longer, for we see only too well how this treatment
injures our ministry, and destroys our influence with the people
committed to our care.</p>
<p>If the Government through an error to which we cannot give
unqualified respect, since it is contrary to the real interests of
religion and of our country, believes that the mission of the Orders in
the islands has come to an end, we nevertheless say to them: &ldquo;We
await your dispositions with sincerity, but do not flatter yourselves
that in adopting measures against our religious professions you can
burn a light both before Christ and before Belial.&rdquo; If, on the
contrary, we are to remain in the islands, no one can deny that it is
necessary to protect our persons, our prestige, and our ministry; our
country must show that she is pleased with us, and treat us as her
children; we must not be abandoned to our enemies as a thing of no
value, and made victims of the resentment of the Freemasons. We do not
fear martyrdom, which is an honor we do not feel ourselves worthy of;
on the other hand, we do not wish to die as criminals abandoned by
their friends and protectors, and deprived of all honor.</p>
<p>It is incredible that religious men placed in our position could be
the cause of the woes of the Archipelago. We <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>prefer
to resign our ministry, and see ourselves expelled, rather than
continue our mission in the islands, if the situation does not better
itself before long. We have done our work well in these islands, and we
feel sure that we shall be able to do our duty quite as well elsewhere
with the grace of God.</p>

<p class="first">We cannot view without grave misgivings the unexpected
turn that affairs have taken since the war, and the second war which
has broken out between the rebels and the Americans. It is now plain
that it was entire independence from all control that the promoters of
the rebellion were looking for from the very beginning; this being well
known to the Friars all along, and clearly indicated in their memorial
to the Spanish Government. Aguinaldo and his companions have unlimited
confidence in themselves, and aspire to form a civilized republic. The
character of this pure-souled patriot may be judged from a transaction
he had with the Spanish Government. After the armistice of
Biac-na-Bato, he was bought out by them, and took thousands of dollars
as his price for leaving the country for aye, never to return. He
pocketed the money, and went off to Hongkong; but when the Americans
came to Manila, and destroyed the Spanish fleet, this worthy returned
to the Philippines, and once more raised <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>the standard of
rebellion. As a result the Americans are apt to find themselves
burdened with a war expenditure, even heavier than that borne by Spain
in her effort to prevent a repetition in the Philippines of the
gruesome story of San Domingo and Hayti. All colored and tropical races
have a tendency to revert to their original type and the barbarous
customs of their ancestors. The blacks got possession of Hayti nearly a
century ago, at which time they were at least domesticated, and
partially civilized, having been in contact with the white man for the
two previous centuries. They have gone back, and not forward, ever
since. The history of the black republic is a bloody revolution every
two or three years, distinguished by acts of barbarous ferocity. Life
there at the present day is a hideous caricature of civilization and
Christianity. Incredible as it may seem, there has been a revival in
the remote villages of the old African serpent-worship, and child
sacrifices, followed by cannibalism.</p>

<p>Ten Spanish Augustinian Friars recently came to San Francisco from
the Philippines (see <a href="#app4">Appendix IV</a>.). In an interview
with the representative of the <i>San Francisco Monitor</i> they stated
that it was not through fear of the Americans that they had left
Manila, but, on the contrary, they believed that the Church would
prosper under American rule. They said that the respectable element in
the Philippines, though they had been quite content <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>with the
Spanish rule, and deeming it all that could be expected under the
circumstances, are yet welcoming the Americans as a relief from
insurgent atrocities. &ldquo;The insurgents,&rdquo; they said,
&ldquo;are an undisciplined mob of rioters, led by a demagogue. They
are the riff-raff of the islands, men without principle or property in
most instances. Aguinaldo has them pretty well in hand to-day, but
to-morrow they may disintegrate into fifty gangs. Aguinaldo is an
ungrateful renegade, who was fed, clothed, and educated by Catholic
priests. He is a mere puppet in the hands of the Freemasons.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e984src" href="#xd20e984" name="xd20e984src">1</a> It
is to these worthies and organized <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89"
href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>anarchy in Europe that we may
trace the origin of the trouble in the Philippines. Soon after the
destruction of the Spanish fleet, the insurgents wrecked our schools,
robbed and despoiled our missions and churches, and drove us into
Manila. About fifty priests were brutally killed by them. As our field
of work was thus laid bare, we decided to leave the Philippines. What
made us depart was the discouragement of seeing the work of years
destroyed by the men we had gone to teach, and the improbability of
being able to build up the work again immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Filipinos have already shown proof how far removed they are from
civilized ideals, and how dangerous it would be to leave them to
themselves, by their inhuman treatment of their Spanish prisoners.
Besides ordinary Spanish civilians, they have kept in captivity for
several months hundreds of Friars, including one hundred Dominicans,
and the Dominican Bishop of Neuva Segovia, Mgr. Joseph Hevia, whose
portrait we give. Numbers of the Friars have lately died of the
hardships to which they were subjected. A letter, received some time
ago from one of them by a friend in Manila, describes the ferocious and
satanic hatred shown towards them by the rebel chiefs. They were
stripped of their clothes, hats, and shoes, robbed of their money, spat
upon, tied to trees, and flogged several times. Daily they were forced
to work on the public roads from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90"
href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>morning to evening, under a
broiling sun, receiving food and drink barely sufficient to support
life. The leaders mocked at and jested over their sufferings. Though
violent threats were held out against all who succored them, their
parishioners seized opportunities of coming to visit them, and
alleviate their miseries. From other sources we learn that the noses of
some of the prisoners were slit, and a cord passed through the
aperture, to be used as a leading-string by their guards. The venerable
Bishop was subjected to the grossest indignities. One aged Friar was
placed on a saddle, and jumped upon till blood flowed from his mouth
and nose. Another, it is said, clothed only in a rain-coat, was carried
in triumph for two hundred yards, and then cudgelled to death amid
savage cries. Some were crushed to death between boards. Nuns in the
convents were subjected to shameful treatment. In the name of common
sense, we ask if men who encourage or permit such atrocities are fit to
control and guide the destinies of eight millions of people. (See
<a href="#app5">Appendix V</a>.)</p>
<p>Of course the policy of the Press in general has been to keep these
atrocities from the eyes of the public. As it did not suit political
purposes to publish them, they have been kept concealed. Owing to this
careful management, the sympathies of the world have been enlisted on
the side of the &ldquo;poor downtrodden Filipinos.&rdquo; An impartial
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>examination of the grievances of the latter, and
of the catch-cries by which the leaders have seduced a considerable
portion of the simple natives, will not reveal very much against either
the civil or the ecclesiastical rule of the Spaniard. As in everything
human, we may suppose that neither was absolute perfection; but, all
things considered, there was less to justify rebellion in the
Philippines than in most parts of the world where the black is ruled by
the white man.</p>
<p>One of the grievances of the rebels is that nearly all the
ecclesiastics in the Archipelago have been Spaniards, and they demand
an entirely native clergy. Now, the Catholic Church has been always
most anxious to form a native clergy in missionary countries, but
insuperable difficulties have often prevented the realization of this
idea. Among colored races there is a paucity of real vocations; it is
hard enough to get the people to live up to the Christian ideal without
adding thereto the grave responsibilities and life of self-sacrifice of
the priesthood. An example in point is the Black Republic of Hayti. It
is a Catholic country, nominally at least. The people have retained the
Faith taught them by the white man, though preserving such a dislike to
him that no white man can own a yard of land in the country. Yet such
is their inability to provide themselves with priests of their own
blood that they are forced to fall back on the services of a French
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>Bishop and French missionary priests, who do all
the spiritual work of the island. Another case in point is that of
Cuba, an island containing a million and a half of inhabitants, Cubans
and Spaniards, of which only forty-three of the former are to be found
in the ranks of the priesthood. There has never been any distinction
made between Cubans and Spaniards in the two Seminaries of Havana and
Santiago de Cuba; all are received alike, and treated alike if they
have a vocation; of the forty-three priests, twenty-eight hold
parishes, and the rest have other positions of trust, which shows that
it is simply owing to lack of vocations and not to any other cause that
we must ascribe their fewness in number. In the Philippines, as far
back as two centuries ago, the experiment was made of forming a native
priesthood, with doubtful success, however, as Dampier informs us that
the natives generally held the native priests in contempt, while
holding the Spanish clergy in the greatest esteem. We must, perforce,
conclude that in the Philippines, as in other countries, it is simply
lack of vocations that keeps the number of the native clergy at such a
low ebb.</p>
<p>Another grievance, brought well to the front by those who have
written on behalf of the Filipinos, is the taxation, which is alleged
to have been excessive. The writer is informed by one who lived many
years there that it was not. However this may be, all taxation is
odious to primitive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93"
name="pb93">93</a>]</span>and half-civilized communities, who are
inclined to look upon the most necessary taxes, without which no stable
government could be carried on, in the light of oppression. The
Americans will have the same difficulties to face with regard to
taxation as the Spaniards had, though not in the same degree maybe, as
the country will be opened to trade in a freer way than formerly. In
the interests of order, and also to protect the people from unjust
imposts, the Friars were in the habit of acting as their counsellors in
these matters, and used to exhort their parishioners publicly and
privately to pay the necessary taxes. A passage from Blumentritt, whom
we have quoted more than once in our previous chapters, will go to show
that all this was done in the interests of the people: &ldquo;In the
following centuries the Friars continued to extend their protecting
hand over the natives, preventing, as far as possible, any oppression
on the part of the Government employ&eacute;s.&rdquo; Yet this action
of the Friars, good, charitable, and necessary under the circumstances,
has been used by the promoters of the rebellion as a fulcrum to raise
the Friars, in the eyes of the poorer classes, into the invidious
position of tax-gatherers, tyrants, and abettors of oppression. Without
doubt, cruel methods, for which, however, the Friars were not
responsible, were in vogue in dealing with defaulters, as we may see in
Dean Worcester&rsquo;s lately published work on the Philippines; but it
is nothing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>less than downright hypocrisy to raise a chorus of
condemnation against the Spaniard on this score, when it is well known
that no other nation, in trying to solve the eternal difficulty about
the taxation of colored and subject races, has emerged from the
conflict with clean hands. We remember reading some years ago of very
cruel methods employed in the gathering of the taxes in British India,
in some of the up-country districts; and within the present year of
grace, 1899, two books have appeared dealing with the English and the
Dutch in South Africa,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1016src" href=
"#xd20e1016" name="xd20e1016src">2</a> both of which, in describing the
punishment inflicted on those refusing to pay taxes to the ruling
powers, could easily give points to the colonial Spaniard for cruelty.
What is very remarkable about the Protestant missionary is that,
instead of condemning the barbarities described in his book, of which
he was an eye-witness, he approves of them, even to the extent of
giving his sanction to the inhuman crime of blowing up with dynamite
the caves in which four hundred men, women, and children had taken
refuge. The Rev. Mr. Rae&rsquo;s opinion of the campaign against
Malaboch for his refusal to pay taxes, a campaign in which women and
children, and men bearing flags of truce were fired upon recklessly, is
that &ldquo;the Transvaal Government was doing a much <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>better
work than any Christian missionary has yet accomplished.&rdquo; God
help the Filipinos if Protestant missionaries of this description are
going to overrun the field of labor left vacant by the deaths and
expulsion of the Spanish Friars. One great test of the mild rule of the
Spaniard in that country is that the native population has increased
since the conquest, instead of being almost exterminated, as is the
case in North America and in many of the colonies of European States.
We hope that the American rule will be characterized by clemency and
justice. A hypocritical cry has been raised in the States about the
tyranny and oppression under which the natives are said to be groaning.
The rule of the Spaniard has indeed been imperfect enough; but America
should approach the question of reform with becoming modesty, seeing
that her own record in dealing with the Indians has been stained by
many a crime against human rights. They have been robbed of the country
which once was their own, and driven back from reservation to
reservation, while even the rights guaranteed to them by Government as
compensation for what they lost have been often filched from them by
unscrupulous officials. The light recently thrown on the case of the
Pillager Indians has disclosed cruelty, open robbery, and a disregard
of solemn obligations. In the Philippines the Americans will find the
natives still in possession of their country; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>a
people, once wild and nomadic like the Indians, brought into settled
habits of life by three centuries of missionary effort; a people, in
fine, who, whatever is said to the contrary by noisy declaimers and
demagogues, have been on the whole well pleased with their lot.</p>

<p>It is quite evident from the words and acts of the rebels that they
have been casting envious eyes on the large landed estates of the
Friars, hoping, on their expulsion, to have a division of the spoils
among themselves. Already, before the war, an iniquitous plan of
confiscation was boldly advocated in Spain itself. We now learn to our
surprise, from the <i>Church News</i> (Washington, D.C.), that this cry
has found an echo across the Atlantic from Protestant pulpits in the
States. Besides the fact that confiscation would be robbery pure and
simple, as the estates are not national property, and have not been
given by the Government, but have been acquired in the usual way by
purchase, and in the course of three centuries have naturally grown
large, confiscation of the estates would mean a great calamity to the
country, even if the Friars were allowed to go back quietly to their
parishes, and resume their spiritual ministrations among the people.
For it was by means of the estates that the Friars introduced
agriculture and settled habits of life among tribes originally nomadic;
it was by means of the estates that they got them to live in villages,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>introduced amongst them the arts of civilized
life; it was by means of the estates that they acquired the power of
inducing them to labor with a certain amount of regularity and method,
the great safeguard against a relapse into a state of savagery.
Giraudier, who was director of the &ldquo;Diario&rdquo; of Manila, and
spent thirty years in the Archipelago, says something very much to the
point: &ldquo;The natives, with some rare exceptions, are in need of
tutelage, without which they would fall back to the customs of their
ancestors, a tutelage that no one can exercise better than the
Friars.&rdquo; The latter, in truth, made themselves all in all to the
people. Within the precincts of the monasteries were to be found
workshops for teaching carpentry, forges for teaching the natives the
working of iron, brick and tileyards,&mdash;in fact, most of the
mechanical arts were fostered and encouraged by the Friars. The
villages they formed around them presented a pleasing picture of
happiness and content, in startling contrast to the homes of those who
were still pagan and uncivilized.</p>
<p>A former British consul thus describes them: &ldquo;Orderly
children, respected parents, women subject but not oppressed, men
ruling but not despotic, reverence with kindness, obedience with
affection&mdash;these form a lovable picture by no means rare in the
villages of the Eastern Isles.&rdquo; Will such a happy state of things
exist under new conditions? We are very much inclined to doubt
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>it. The experiment tried in some of the islands of
the West Indies of making the blacks small freeholders, and planting
them on the bankrupt planters&rsquo; estates, has not been attended by
such beneficial results to the land as to justify our hoping that a
similar experiment in the Philippines will prove a success. The natives
of the tropics in general are like overgrown children, blessed with the
virtues and cursed with the faults of children, rejoicing in present
abundance, and destitute of that measure of forethought for the morrow,
without which there can be no human progress. What a contrast at the
present day do the civilized villages under the paternal care, and, if
you will, government, of Friars present to the wild nomadic life still
led by the natives of Mindanao, whom the Jesuit fathers are trying to
bring under civilizing influences. We find, from letters written lately
by some of the fathers there, that human sacrifice is still in vogue,
and murder, pillage, and slave-catching extremely common. We fear that
self-government, bringing in internal conflicts between the various
parts of the Archipelago, would gradually reduce most of it to this
deplorable state of things, and that the Philippine Republic would be
as great a travesty on civilization as Hayti. <span class=

<p class="first">We cannot too strongly emphasize the great interest
that the change of government in the Philippines should have for the
English-speaking Catholic public, seeing that a Catholic population, as
large, if not larger, than the combined Catholic population of England,
Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, is about to be brought under the
influence of the English-speaking world, and in close touch with the
Catholic Church in America, and, perhaps, later on, with ourselves. It
is not more than a year ago that the Philippines were a <i>terra
incognita</i> to us all, of which we knew the name, but hardly more.
For the last ten months they have been brought under our notice almost
daily by the newspapers, and monthly in the pages of the magazines. In
the meantime their control has passed from Spain to America, and a
conflict of opinion is going on in the States as to the desirability or
otherwise of undertaking the responsibility of their future government.
Under the old <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span><i>r&eacute;gime</i>, Church and State were
united: a bearable condition when the State was professedly Catholic,
but absolutely unbearable when antagonistic influences control the
Government, hamper the Church in her freedom of action, and degrade her
into servitude while professing to be her protector. In the new
condition of things the Church will be placed in the same position as
it holds in America, free to flourish or to die, depending entirely on
its own resources, and neither helped nor persecuted by the State. Its
ministers, though not enjoying any special privileges, will be
protected in their persons and property in common with all other
citizens. Its religious orders will receive the same recognition as
secular corporations, and their corporate property will be respected.
So far so good; for it was to be feared that the Spanish Government,
who had been deterred only by political motives from suppressing the
Orders, yielding at last to the pressure of the Freemasons, might have
confiscated their property, and either secularized their members or
expelled them from the islands. Still we cannot close our eyes to the
fact that dangers from a different quarter loom up which it much
behooves Catholics to carefully consider. There is a pressing necessity
of being alive to those dangers, if worse evils than ever are not to
befall that large Catholic population of the Far East.</p>
<p>As might be expected, the Protestant missionary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>bodies have inaugurated a movement for sending
out missionaries of their own to the Archipelago. The Rev. John R.
Hykes was directed last September by the American Bible Society to
proceed from Shanghai to Manila, and investigate concerning the
Philippines &ldquo;as a field for Bible work.&rdquo; He submitted his
report in a very short time, having made up his mind on the religious
needs of the people, the scandalous lives of the Friars, and the
superstition of their benighted parishioners with incredible rapidity.
His sensational report duly appeared in the American papers as the
&ldquo;Startling Revelations made by the Rev. John R. Hykes.&rdquo;
Sure of a sympathetic audience, he laid on the colors thickly. The
report need not occupy much of our attention. Half of it is made up of
ordinary information about the country that any one could get for
himself out of a good encyclop&aelig;dia, and the other half is a
rehash and repetition of the charges already dealt with by us in
previous chapters. One statement is, however, worth noticing, as it
clearly indicates the hopelessness of getting fair and unbiassed
treatment from the enemies of the Church. Mr. Hykes states that he was
shocked by the stories of immorality brought against the Friars. And,
to make an impression, he adds that the people who told him the stories
said they were prepared to give names, dates, and places in
confirmation of what they said. Now, as already noted, names,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>dates, and places were the very things asked for
by the Friars in the Memorial to the Spanish Government, as far back as
last April; but their enemies, finding those details beyond their
power, have adopted the simpler process of repeating the calumnies to
all who, like Mr. Hykes, give them a ready and sympathetic hearing. Mr.
Hykes, who never went beyond Manila, presumes to judge, in a few days
or weeks, of the spiritual condition of six millions of Christians, and
more than a thousand priests, scattered over the whole Philippine
Archipelago. (See <a href="#app6">Appendix VI</a>.) We are afraid that
too many of the type of Mr. Hykes will be found among the new
missionaries of the Philippines, coming in crowds, with their wives and
children, to spread, forsooth, the pure light of the Gospel, or rather
to engage in the more congenial task of vilifying the Catholic
Church.</p>
<p>In an American Protestant missionary review, there is an article on
the Philippines, by a former agent of the British and Foreign Bible
Society in that country. The article, needless to say, is full of gross
misrepresentations. It puts down the Christian population as seven
million <i>Romanists</i>; the writer denies the ordinary title of
Christian to Catholics. This emissary of the Bible Society writes:
&ldquo;The question now asked on all sides is&mdash;Are the Philippines
at last to be opened to missionary effort? Personally, I feel that a
non-sectarian, but strictly evangelical, mission, aiming <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>at
the Christianization of the whole territory, is what would succeed
best.&rdquo; We may gather from the whole tone of this Protestant
missionary review what a low type of Protestantism it represents, a
type largely made up of self-presumption, ignorance, and fanaticism.
Throughout the paper Catholics are not once designated Christian. It
speaks of the nineteenth century being the first century of Christian
missions, ignoring all the apostolic work of the Catholic Church. It
says in another place that there were no Christian Chinese at the
beginning of this century, ignoring the hundreds of thousands of
Chinese who have known and loved Jesus Christ since the days of St.
Francis Xavier, numbers of whom sealed their faith with their blood. It
divides the population of the country into pagans, Romanists, and
Christians&mdash;the latter, of course, being Protestants of one
denomination or another. To such absurd lengths does religious rancor
bring it, and all connected with it. Catholics give the title of
Christian to all who are baptized and profess belief in the Divinity of
Jesus Christ. They would not deny it even to the Rev. Mr. Hykes, bad as
he is. But perhaps our new missionary friends may be similar to those
of whom Marshall speaks in his &ldquo;Christian Missions,&rdquo; who
went out to evangelize the South Sea Islands, and taught the people
that baptism was merely a ceremony not at all essential to salvation,
thus showing their want of belief in baptismal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>regeneration. At any rate, it will be news to
the Filipinos to hear for the first time from these enlightened men
that they are not Christians.</p>
<p>That these Bible scatterers can and will do harm there is no doubt.
Already they have flooded Porto Rico with tracts and pamphlets, crammed
with the usual vile charges against the Catholic Church and her
ministers. But it is equally certain that they will never succeed in
making the Philippines a Protestant country. It is a matter of
notoriety that Protestant missions are not overwhelmingly successful in
any part of the world, and that the funds are kept up in most instances
by glowing and rosy-colored, if not altogether accurate, reports, sent
by the missionaries to their supporters at home. The review which I
have just quoted is forced to acknowledge that in Brazil, after
thirty-five years&rsquo; work, there are only eight thousand
Protestants out of a population of sixteen millions. No less than eight
American Protestant Missionary Societies have been working there
together, well supplied with funds, as is always the case; and yet this
is the result. In fact, eight thousand may not be the result at all,
for the missionaries have, very often, peculiar methods in the science
of statistics. In Mexico, too, they have been at work for many years
unmolested by the authorities, and yet they have but wretched results
to show for themselves at the present day. They make no impression
either on the rich or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href=
"#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>the very poor; any successes they
have being amongst the impecunious middle classes, the children of whom
they teach gratuitously in their schools, and feed and clothe, and who
carry away with them from these schools, as the principal result of the
religious training they receive, a bitter hatred of the Church in which
they were born. Just as in Mexico, so the Protestant missionaries are
sure to make proselytes among the same classes in the Philippines, from
which classes we know that the promoters of the rebellion have been
mainly recruited; but the better classes and also the poorer, whatever
their shortcomings, have the old Faith and are intensely devoted to the
Catholic Church. These are no more likely than the people of Mexico and
Brazil to be led to accept the mutilated form of Christianity which
will be presented to them by Mr. Hykes and his friends; unless, indeed,
there is such a deplorable dearth of priests that they will be left
without instruction and guidance.</p>

<p>There are grave problems ahead which will tax the wisdom of the
American Congress far more than the military occupation of the country.
John Foreman, who spent some years there, and claims to be a Catholic,
advocates (<i>National Review</i>, September, 1898) the disendowment of
the Church as a necessary financial measure which would bring a certain
amount of relief to the colonial treasury. With the exception of
&pound;3,000 a year paid to the Archbishop <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>of
Manila, and &pound;1,500 to each of the three other bishops, it is
difficult to see how the endowment comes in except as a measure adopted
by every civilized State in dealing with its uncivilized subject races;
and unless the United States is prepared to abandon the
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> of civilizer, she will be obliged to keep up the
paltry endowment made in the past by Spain for that purpose. The Church
in the Philippines is, on the whole, self-supporting. She is in the
position that the Church in France, Spain, and Portugal was before the
Revolution, which, when it appeared successively in each country was
followed by a seizure of ecclesiastical property. The salaries paid to
the clergy in those countries are given as a compensation for past
robberies. The writer has been at pains to get at the truth in this
matter and has put himself in communication with a Dominican Friar, who
lived for twenty-seven years in the Philippines, and now holds the
distinguished position of Rector of the Spanish-Dominican College, in
Rome. From him the writer has received the following information
regarding the landed estates of the Friars, and the salaries paid to
them by the Spanish Government. As far as he knows all these estates
were acquired by purchase, and were not given by the Government; they
hold the title-deeds of them in their possession. He is not prepared to
say whether on their first introduction to the country, three centuries
ago, the Government <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107"
name="pb107">107</a>]</span>made them grants of land; but we ourselves
may infer from the early history of the Dominicans there, that whatever
they got was from the early Spanish colonists and the converted natives
as free gifts. He adds that in any case the introduction of agriculture
is due to their exertions. The Friars who ministered to the spiritual
wants of the people may be placed in three categories. There were,
first of all, the ordinary parish priest, who lived among a settled
Catholic population. He subsisted on his benefice, which is not
Government property, and was endowed by no subsidy from the Government.
Secondly, there was the missionary parish priest, who lived in a parish
where the majority are Catholics, but which also contained a proportion
of the heathen. He received some salary from the Government, but much
less than that given to the missionaries pure and simple, who lived in
the midst of an entirely heathen population. These latter, whose
business it was to civilize as well as convert the people to
Christianity, and to teach them agriculture and the mechanical arts,
were paid according as the mission district was large or small. In the
large districts they received &pound;200 annually, and &pound;50 a year
was paid to the native priests who acted as their assistants and
curates. In the smaller districts the sum allowed was &pound;100. The
Jesuits, too, on their return to the Philippines some forty years ago,
whence they had been banished in the middle of the last century, got an
annual <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>subsidy as compensation for the lands they
formerly possessed, which had been confiscated by the Spanish
Government of the day. Something also was given towards the education
of young Franciscan missionaries, and they were allowed their passage
out from Spain. The figures we have quoted are modest enough, seen in
the light of modern colonial salaries and expenditure. A continuance of
the very moderate subsidies allowed to the missionary Friars by the
Spanish Government would no more mean a union between Church and State
than did the &ldquo;contract&rdquo; system which was sanctioned by
Congress up to 1894, for dealing with the education of the North
American Indians. According to this system, both Catholic and
Protestant missionaries were paid by Government according to the number
of pupils who attended their schools, and these schools, of course,
were taught on strictly denominational lines. That system had most
beneficial results as long as it lasted, and was acceptable to the
Indians. Its abandonment in favor of the public-school system has
resulted in the crying injustice of compelling Catholic Indian fathers
and mothers to send their children to certain schools to which they
have a conscientious objection.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1097src"
href="#xd20e1097" name="xd20e1097src">1</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p>The school question is one of the gravest problems that the American
Government will be called upon to face when her troops have effectively
occupied the Philippines. One of the cries of the rebel leaders is for
the secularization of the schools, and this cry, emanating from infidel
and secret society sources, will assuredly be echoed by the Protestant
ministers. It was these latter who, seeing their ministrations rejected
by the Indians, raised the agitation against the &ldquo;contract&rdquo;
system.</p>
<p>It is a shame and a wonder to find professed ministers of religion
joining in a cry with the professed destroyers of religion.
Secularization of education is always the first cry among those who
oppose the Catholic religion. According to the showing of Dr. Parsons,
it was attempted and sometimes successfully carried out in Colombia,
Chili, and Ecuador, in which latter country the bishops were banished
because they protested against it. Yet in spite of the anti-Christian
spirit, exhibited in this and in many other ways, Dr. Parsons makes it
clear that the masonic lodges in Peru actually receive aid out of the
funds supplied to Christianize (according to sectarian ideas) the
natives by the Protestant American public.</p>
<p>The notorious ex-Indian commissioner Morgan, now a Baptist prophet,
has already sounded a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href=
"#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>characteristically aggressive note
on this point, and is conjuring the Government to drive the Catholic
religion out of all the schools in Cuba, a movement already
accomplished in the eastern part of the island. Morgan says:
&ldquo;Here is a field opened for the missionary spirit, such as the
young people of our country have never yet seen. To carry thither and
plant the seeds of civilization, and to do this in the joyful
confidence that all official assistance is assured to them, will
doubtlessly fill with enthusiasm hundreds of ambitious young
teachers.&rdquo; We may wonder what Morgan means by &ldquo;official
assistance&rdquo; given for the spreading of Protestantism among a
Catholic people, when, according to theory, the American Constitution
does not support one form of religion over another. But theory is one
thing and practice is another; and though in theory Church and State
are entirely separate, the theory has not, in the past, hindered the
United States from giving substantial assistance to Protestantism. This
is how the case stands for America. Rightly or wrongly she has taken
over an enormous Catholic population in the East. If she is not able to
make any concession on the score of religion, or to stretch a point to
meet the wishes of the people and govern them according to their ideas,
then it is only consonant with reason and justice that her
Constitution, which never contemplated colonial empire, will have to be
modified to meet the exigencies of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111"
href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>a situation unimagined by its
original founders and makers. But, in reality, is any modification of
the Constitution necessary in order that religious instruction may take
place in the schools of the Archipelago? In Ireland there is no State
Church, and yet the National School System is so arranged that
religious instruction can be given for half an hour every day of the
week. The system is in theory undenominational, but in practice
denominational.</p>
<p>An early solution of the difficulty might be some such procedure as
the following. Let the parish priests be managers of the schools, and
have a voice in the appointment of properly certified masters and
mistresses, and let a fixed time be devoted to religious instruction
every day. If the Protestants succeed in attracting converts, and are
able to gather a sufficient number of children in any place to form a
school, they can receive the same treatment as regards payment and
control of religious instruction. Thus religious dissension would be
reduced to the minimum. Secularization of education would tend to drive
every form of religion out of the people, for Protestantism could not
hope to make headway for a long time in the Philippines; as, to say the
least, it would take some years for the ministers to get a sufficient
knowledge of the various languages in use, and establish themselves in
face of the opposition they are sure to meet with. It would also put
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>all the Friars in opposition to the Government,
while fair treatment would make them its best friends, and urge them to
keep the people as loyal to the American Constitution as they kept them
to the Spanish Crown for three centuries.</p>
<p>If, then, the Government, after due inquiry, find that the vast
majority of the people do not join in the cry for secularization, but
desire to have the Catholic religion taught in the schools which their
children attend, it would be nothing short of religious persecution to
introduce the public schools system of the States into the Philippines.
It is ever to be borne in mind that the new American possession in the
Far East is one in which the great bulk of the people are practical
Catholics who attend to all their religious duties.</p>
<p>To counteract the baleful influence of the Protestant missionary and
Bible societies, it will be necessary for the Catholic Church in
America to be alive to the new and grave responsibilities thus thrown
upon her by the hand of Providence, and to send out English-speaking
priests at once to the Philippines, to make up for the great dearth of
priests caused by the excesses of the rebels. Before the rebellion they
numbered between one and two thousand, a small number in comparison
with the Catholic population. Fifty have been killed outright; many
others have died of the hardships undergone in captivity; while several
hundreds have left the country, apparently with no intention
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>of returning. Every year till last year, bands
of enthusiastic young missionaries used to go out from the colleges in
Spain to fill up the gaps in the ranks of the Friars, caused by
sickness and death. That perennial source of life and strength can no
longer be relied upon under the new conditions. The energies of the
Spanish Friars will most likely be expended in Spain itself, where the
lack of priests is still severely felt, and in developing their great
and flourishing missions in China, Japan, Tonquin, and Formosa.</p>
<p>It is a matter of astonishment that the Church in the United States
has up to the present no organization for supplying foreign mission.
Perhaps the struggle to keep abreast in numbers with the growing
Catholic population has absorbed all her energies. But now, for the
first time in her history, she must cast her eyes beyond her
boundaries, and send speedy help to the millions of children who have
been given to her keeping, and whose voice may be heard from across the
wide ocean, calling to her for spiritual help and ministration. Let her
gaze steadily and thoughtfully on the vast harvest of souls given unto
her. She shall reap where others have sown and planted. Let her gird
herself to the work, and go forth and gather with joy the good wheat
that others&mdash;the poor Spanish missionaries&mdash;have sown in
tears and cultivated through much tribulation.</p>
<p>A fact of interest in connection with the aspect <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>of
our subject under consideration is the challenge sent to Archbishop
Ireland by an American Presbyterian of authority in his sect. He tells
the Archbishop in effect that if the Catholic Church in the United
States will undertake the missionary equipment of the Philippines, his
sect will gladly withdraw from the field, and devote their efforts to
Africa instead. Without attaching any more importance to this
declaration than it deserves, especially as it is founded on the false
assumption that one Gospel is preached by Catholic priests in
Washington and another in Manila, we may, nevertheless, infer from it
that these men believe they would have a much easier task in dealing
with the Spanish missionaries than with Catholic missionaries from the
States. Without saying anything in disparagement of the learning of a
body of men which has produced a Gonzalez, one of the greatest
philosophers of the century, we believe that American priests, being
more in touch with modern times and more open to modern ideas, could
give them valuable lessons in the conflict between the Church and the
world, as it is carried on in our own days. It is not by profound
theological arguments that we can deal with men who can neither
understand nor appreciate them. Priests are wanted for the Philippines
who can make their voices heard beyond its boundaries; who can mould
public opinion by means of the daily Press; who can keep in touch with
the politics <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>and legislation of the United States; and can
bring public opinion there to bear on unjust and unfair treatment, if
anything of the kind is attempted against the Catholics of that
unfortunate Archipelago.</p>

Though it embraces various matters, we think it better to give it
altogether, as it possesses a peculiar authority and interest of its
own, coming as it does from a Friar who lived in the Philippines for
twenty-seven years, and who knew the country well in its normal and
peaceful state, long before the Freemasons had wrought havoc in the
relations between the priests and the people.</p>
<p>1. Those who were principally engaged in writing against the Friars
for the past few years, and injuring their prestige at home, were the
civil functionaries and military officers, who for the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>most
part lived at Manila and knew next to nothing about them and their
doings. These men were biased by anti-religious ideas implanted in them
by an irreligious education. It is easy to estimate the effect of an
enormous correspondence of this kind, leaving Manila every fortnight,
and passing into the hands of politicians in the mother-country,
especially as there was nothing to counteract its influence on the part
of the Friars, who did their work quietly and earnestly, and had very
little correspondence with Spain at all.</p>
<p>2. The parish priests were <i>ex-officio</i> inspectors of the
primary schools, but, having no voice in the appointment of masters and
mistresses, and finding unsuitable persons thrust on them, were forced
in many cases to retire from the schools in disgust, and limit their
connection with them as much as possible.</p>
<p>3. The parish priests were also <i>ex-officio</i> presidents of
certain municipal committees, and were supposed to help in the
appointment of justices of the peace and petty governors, by sending in
reports of the qualifications or otherwise of the nominees. The system
worked well for a long time. But, latterly, owing to the new spirit in
Manila, where the persons in office seemed leagued against the Friars,
these privileged communications invariably leaked out; and if the
parish priest, as in duty bound, laid bare defects and deficiencies the
first to hear of it would be the person of whom <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>they
were told. This was naturally a constant source of irritation and loss
of prestige. The officials seemed to take a delight in lowering the
parish priest in the eyes of the better class of natives. If the parish
priest ventured to advise the governors as to what was best to be done
in the interests of the communes, especially with regard to the secret
societies, the governors would laugh, call him a visionary&mdash;an
innocent man. No wonder, then, that the parish priests gradually began
to retire within themselves, and leave growing evils unchecked, when
they saw all their endeavor balked by the powerful opposition of the
civil and military governors. This untoward state of things left the
rebels free to mature and carry out their plans.</p>
<p>4. Here is an instance of how badly this state of things reacted on
the country. The introduction of the new Penal Code was a great blunder
of the Government. It was unnecessary; the natives were all opposed to
it, and the strength and extent of that opposition was well known to
the Friars who lived in the midst of the people. Under normal
conditions they would have advised the repeal of the Code, and their
advice would have been taken. But they were forced to remain silent
while the Government in its folly was putting the obnoxious Code in
force. If they had warned the Government, instead of getting the
respectful hearing to which they were entitled, by their long
experience and their intimate knowledge <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>of the people, they
would simply have been dubbed reactionists.</p>
<p>5. How foolish it was of the Government to alienate the most loyal
Spaniards in the whole Archipelago, the most distinctively Spanish
element,&mdash;the Friars. They were almost ultra-loyal, and did their
best to inspire feelings of loyalty in the breasts of the natives. They
were powerful bodies with a strong bond of cohesion, having large
interests in the country. They had glorious traditions to look back
upon and keep them up to the ideal they had formed of their mission
martyrs, a history to remember with pride; and all around them a
Christian people, the fruit of their apostolic toil and that of their
predecessors. The officials, on the other hand, were mere birds of
passage, who took no real interest in the country. It was a case of
every one for himself; every official keeping his eye on Spain with a
view to an early return, while he went through his appointed work. It
is remarkable too that in the Philippines there is no class of old rich
Spanish families such as are to be found in other colonies; the
families are all of yesterday&mdash;the riches in the hands of Chinese
merchants, and the foreign trade in the hands of the English and
Germans.</p>
<p>6. It used to be said that the Friars wished to have a hand in
everything. The three important departments of justice, finance, and
military affairs were outside their province altogether, and these as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>purely secular matters they never touched. The
complaint arose from their being ever ready to preach against sedition
and disloyalty, and to use their moral influence publicly and privately
for that purpose. But the Friars for the sake of the people did take
part in other than purely spiritual concerns, and the activity of mind
it engendered was personally a great help and relief to them. The
general rule is that young priests, coming over for the first time,
suffer a great deal from that <i>ennui</i> to which all classes of
Europeans are subject to in the Archipelago. Gradually the sense of the
sublime duties to which they have vowed themselves, and the example of
the older brethren work a wonderful change in them for the better. They
then begin to throw themselves with ardor into their work, and
identifying themselves with the people among whom their ministrations
lie, take a great interest even in their temporal affairs, and are glad
to help them over their difficulties, especially those arising between
them and the governors. Any friction between the governors and the
Friars has generally arisen from the latter being prompt to defend the
rights of the natives.</p>
<p>7. It is untrue to say that the Friars did not wish to spread the
Spanish language. What they were opposed to was the folly of trying to
teach the Christian doctrine and some other elementary knowledge in a
language not understood by the people. In this matter they gave their
candid <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>opinion to the Government that it was impossible
to teach Spanish in out-of-the-way rural schools. But in towns they
taught in Spanish, and taught the Spanish language and literature. They
used to induce parents to send their children to Manila for the purpose
of learning Spanish.</p>
<p>8. Regarding their opposition to the rebellion from the pulpit, in
private conversation, and by means of the press, they fought the secret
societies, its principal cause, and the propagation of evil and
irreligious literature. They pointed out these evils on several
occasions since 1887 to the governors, and were told in reply that
these societies were of no importance, that they had nothing to do with
the rebellion, and, in fact, that the preparations of the rebels were
of no serious consequence. General Weyler was the only governor who
gave them a hearing. With that solitary exception the official element
remained incredulous. The secret society of the
&ldquo;Katipunan,&rdquo; the compact of blood, and the enrolment of
levies, were all discovered by the Prior of Guadalupe, who sent a
report of it to General Blanco three months before the rising took
place. Padre Mariane Gol exposed the intentions of the lodges a long
time before Aug. 19, 1898, and also gave notice of concealed deposits
of arms, and a detailed account of what took place at Manila on the
arrival of the Japanese ship Konga.</p>

<p class="first">Missionaries supplied by the religions Orders in the
Philippines to the large fields of labor in China and Japan are not
confined to the Dominicans, but as we have not details at hand
regarding the other Orders, we present to our readers part of the work
done by the Dominicans, which will serve as a specimen of the rest.</p>
<p>The Dominicans have charge since 1631 of the Vicariate Apostolic of
Fo-Kien, which at present contains 20,000,000 inhabitants. The Most
Rev. Dr. Salvator Masot, O.P., is the present Vicar-apostolic, and
working under him are eighteen Spanish Dominicans, one native
Dominican, and twelve secular native priests. The vicariate is divided
into twenty-two districts, each under the care of a priest, and the
Christian population numbers 35,000. The districts are subdivided into
what are called <i>Christianities</i>, or places of meeting where
prayer is said, and the Christian doctrine taught. About fifty of them
are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>provided with an oratory or chapel where Mass is
said, and the sacraments administered; and they have also attached to
them thirty schools for boys and eight for girls. There is also under
the care of the Dominicans a seminary for the education of young native
students who show a vocation for the priesthood.</p>
<p>In 1883 part of the vicariate was cut off and formed into the
Vicariate Apostolic of Amoy, which also was made to embrace the Island
of Formosa. The most Rev. Dr. Ignatius Ibanez is Vicar-apostolic, and
under his direction are working fourteen Spanish Dominicans, one native
Dominican. The vicariate is divided into fourteen districts, half of
which are in Formosa. They have forty chapels or oratories, twenty
schools for boys and girls, and a seminary in the town of Ta-Kow in
Formosa.</p>
<p>A few words about the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Dominic, who
are engaged on the work of the Holy Infancy in both vicariates, will be
interesting. There are fifteen European sisters in all, besides eight
native women. They have five orphanages in which are housed 200 female
orphans abandoned by their unnatural parents in infancy, and kept by
the Sisters till they can marry them into Christian families. Besides
these they have rescued since 1891, 800 others whom they place under
the care of Christian nurses, and look after till they can settle them
in life.</p>
<p>The only fact we can give of the Vicariate of Central Tonquin, also
under the care of the Philippine Dominicans, is that in 1890 alone
2,100 natives were converted and baptized. <span class=

<p class="first">&ldquo;The mission of the Religious Orders is not
over, as is pretended by some who, having fallen foul of them, seek to
abolish them altogether, or at least to restrict and limit their
influence. It is this spirit of jealousy that has dictated many of the
so-called reforms, which we have seen enforced of late years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But these people seem to forget that we have established our
authority in Luzon and the Visayas by the exercise of moral influence
alone, backed up by the parish priest, for as none has such intimate
and friendly relations with the people as the priest, so no one knows
better than he what the people think, nor is any one better able to
give them wise advice, to restrain them, and influence them for good.
He alone can make Spaniards of them. By his office and position he is
best fitted to make things easy for our minor officials in their
different charges and districts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remove the control of Religion, and what do you do? You
remove the Spanish element, forgetful of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>the fact that we have
to depend on a native army whose dialect we do not understand, and who,
in turn, understand not ours; that we have amongst us but a very
limited number of Spanish soldiers&mdash;this is really how we are
situated. I firmly believe that the day that witnesses the abolition of
the Religious Orders, or even the serious restriction of their
influence, will also witness the loss of Cuba and <span class="corr"
id="xd20e1231" title="Source: Porto">Puerto</span> Rico. Even were we
to fill the ranks of the army entirely with Spanish recruits, we should
not improve matters, for then there would be an immense increase to the
expenditure, whereas at present the Orders cost us next to nothing. All
the religious live in common after the manner of a corporation; so that
whatever the priest receives, goes to the support of all, and to
maintain their colleges and seminaries in Spain. Far, then, from being
an inconvenience in the Philippines, religious zeal is our surest
support, and should be by every means promoted and encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives are naturally simple and credulous, and of little
discernment; and so are prone to superstition and idolatry, and can be
easily imposed upon by any quick-witted impostor who is able to relate
strange and wonderful stories. To prevent them being drawn away, the
light of the true religion is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Luzon and the Visayas the Government should make religion
a support on which to lean, and should regard the existence of the
Religious Orders as a most effective means of spreading and diffusing
civilization, and of consolidating vast multitudes of men of different
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>and widely separated races. It is only by
gaining the good-will of these masses we can hope to rule them and draw
them to ourselves. In the establishing of new outposts and ranches, we
must count on the influence of the missionary. It is with this end in
view that I have established certain missions, which will, I hope, in a
few years give the most satisfactory results. I hope that they will be
even the indirect means of increasing the revenues and income of the
State, although the new Christians are to be free of all taxes for the
next ten years. In a word, I know of no better means of civilizing the
natives than the missionary post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is clear that as society progresses in civilization and
enlightenment, the less we are dependent on the influence of the
priest; for as civilization advances organization becomes more perfect.
What I deduce from this is that the reforms necessary in these islands
should be carried out in logical succession, and in proportion to the
state of civilization in each province.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To aid us in accomplishing this good work, it is necessary
that we should multiply the means for the diffusion of learning, for
teaching the Spanish language, encourage and stimulate labor and
industry, banish as far as possible card-playing and gambling, and
extinguish certain instincts and customs peculiar to half-civilized
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are my aims, and to their realization I have devoted
myself with earnestness, taking for my programme&mdash;if I might so
express it&mdash;the advancement <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127"
href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>and strengthening of the
civil authority, the spreading of civilization and learning, so that
the country may enjoy at no distant date the blessings that have come
to other countries through the same means.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this, in my opinion, can only be achieved through the
Religious Orders. For let the Government bear in mind that those who
deny this are filibusters, who desire the absolute independence of the
country, and who knew well that their greatest obstacle is to be found
in those holy men who have the charge of souls in the
Philippines.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;Though I desire to enforce the laws with
strictness, yet I am at the same time most anxious to safeguard the
moral and material interests of the people over whom I rule. It has
ever been my constant study to maintain on the one hand all the royal
prerogatives in their entire amplitude and vigor; and on the other to
make every concession consistent with these prerogatives, which justice
and reason demand, and thus preserve the close relations which should
exist between the religious and political powers. I regard this
relation and harmony between these two powers as the very foundation of
social order&mdash;in this country particularly, where religion and
patriotism are interwoven in all its past history, and pre-existing
institutions, and where they must bring about its future peace and
prosperity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My efforts in this direction have, I rejoice to say, been
greatly strengthened by the loyal and unconditional <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>assistance given to my authority by all the
Religious Orders of the country. These bodies, to the glory of Spain be
it recorded, are composed of excellent and truly devoted men; men who
without one hope of earthly reward, without a hope of ever again
treading their native land, sacrifice with generous enthusiasm their
lives, social surroundings, personal friendships, nay, even, in some
places, their daily bread, to spread the light of the Gospel, and
promote the interests of Spain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They spend themselves in their efforts to instil the love of
faith and fatherland into the simple minds of the innocent inhabitants
of these distant lands, and thus lay the best and surest foundations of
a true civilization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aided in this manner it has been comparatively easy for me to
effect many of the necessary reforms in different parts of this
Province; to establish useful institutions, and to aid the Supreme
Government by founding many benevolent societies, such as the Monte de
Piet&acirc; and the Savings Bank, which I hope will put an end to the
extortions of greedy speculators. Many villages have submitted to us in
the provinces of North Luzon without our having had to employ force to
any extent worth speaking of. This happy result has been brought about
almost entirely by the good offices of the Religious Orders,&mdash;I
mean by their preaching, their advice, the holy example of their lives,
their tact, self-denial, and sacrifices.</p>

gratitude.&rdquo;... <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129"

<h2 class="main">The Work of Freemasonry in South and Central
America.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A writer in the <i>San Francisco Monitor</i> has made
a very intelligible and instructive abstract of an article recently
written by Rev. Reuben Parsons, D.D., on &ldquo;Freemasonry in Latin
America.&rdquo; This is a subject upon which there is much popular
misapprehension, and Dr. Parsons throws a strong light upon it. His
language is, all in all, moderate; and his tone, temperate. He makes no
vicious attack upon the Order, and all his assertions are substantiated
by quotations from Masonic organs or unprejudiced sources. He exposes
the systematic attacks which the lodges have made upon religion; the
persecutions to which they have subjected not only the bishops but the
laity; the war they have waged against religious education. And he
proves all his charges from the mouths of the Masons themselves.</p>
<p>Freemasonry in the United States and Freemasonry in Catholic
countries are two distinct institutions. Freemasonry among us is a
benevolent society with a creed and a ritual. It does not exhibit any
symptoms <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>of bigotry. But in France, Spain, and Italy a
main purpose seems to be opposition to the Church. In France the
Masonic clique which runs the government has kept the Church in
bondage; in Italy Masonry was most active in the movement which
overthrew the temporal power of the Pope. In Latin America, as Dr.
Parsons shows, it has started revolutions, assassinated the leaders of
the people, exiled the clergy, and persecuted the Church. Fortunately,
however, its domination has been short-lived in most of the South
American republics, owing to the universal disgust which its violent
measures excited. Brazil was the scene of the most important fight that
Freemasonry waged against the Church in South America. For many years
the society had been establishing itself in that country, but it was
only during the reign of Don Pedro II. (1831&ndash;1889) that an open
rupture occurred. There were two Grand Lodges in Brazil&mdash;one
monarchial and the other revolutionary. In 1872 the president of the
former had some measures passed in Parliament which were highly
pleasing to his followers. A banquet was tendered to him, and a feature
of the affair was an address by a priest. The priest was suspended by
his bishop, and, at once, the Masons were on the warpath. Both lodges
sank their differences, and united in their opposition to what they
were pleased to call an infringement of their liberty. Their first act
of defiance was the announcement of a Mass to be celebrated for one of
their brethren who had died in rebellion against the Church. Next day
they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>turned their attention to the provinces and
attempted to have a Mass of thanksgiving celebrated in commemoration of
the foundation of the lodge at Olinda. The bishop immediately warned
his priests against this defiance of spiritual authority. The Masons
retorted by charging that some priests were members of that sect, and
that the parish confraternities were honeycombed with masonry. It was
found that some of the confraternities attached to the churches were
controlled by the Masons. The bishop forbade the infected societies to
hold services in their chapels. Those thus censured, disregarded the
prohibition, and even went so far in their defiance as to appear in
church in full regalia. When holy communion was refused them &ldquo;in
their Masonic capacity,&rdquo; they boldly took possession of the keys
of the tabernacle. The priests were thus forced to go to the president
of the local Masonic confraternity whenever they were called upon to
administer the holy viaticum to the dying, and ask from him the
necessary keys.</p>
<p>Of course such a condition could not long continue. The Masons
appealed to the minister of ecclesiastical affairs, who was himself in
high standing in the Order. He decided that the bishops should withdraw
their interdict against the confraternities. Just at this time, the
bishop of Olinda received a papal brief approving of his action. The
brief was published by the prelate, who was thereupon arrested and
charged with the terrible crime of promulgating an ecclesiastical
mandate without permission of the Emperor. In every country where the
Church is free, the ecclesiastical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132"
href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>authorities enjoy the right
of ruling and directing their flock in spiritual matters. It would
seem, according to the Masonic idea and the weak-minded Don Pedro, that
the bishop should not take any action without consulting the temporal
rulers.</p>
<p>The intrepid prelate was sentenced to four years in the
penitentiary. When his case was disposed of, the bishop of Para was
arrested and received the same sentence, besides being subjected to
insults worse than the penitentiary could offer. One of the condemned
confraternities celebrated its feast in 1877 with a grand procession,
the most prominent feature of which was a series of indecent pictures.
The bishop of the diocese where the outrage occurred felt it his duty
to speak out against the sacrilegious act. He prohibited the shameless
society from using its chapel, but after two years of legal proceedings
the case was decided against him. On the night of the decision, the
Masons celebrated their victory by hooting the prelate and illuminating
their headquarters. These excesses disgusted the Catholics of Brazil,
and popular indignation forced the Masons to be more prudent and to
confine themselves to secret intrigues. As outlined in the address of
their Grand Master, their policy should be to obtain control of the
schools, to introduce a bill which would make marriage merely a civil
contract, and to secularize the cemeteries. In 1880, however, the sect
met with reverses, and the new government was not under Masonic
influences. Many of the deluded members <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>abjured their errors,
and the Church in Brazil has enjoyed comparative freedom since that
time.</p>
<p>Freemasonry makes loud boasts of enlightenment and independence, but
it hounded to death the most enlightened and liberty-loving patriot
that South America has ever produced&mdash;Simon Bolivar, the
Liberator. He studied law in Madrid, and on his return home joined the
patriots who revolted against Spain. He freed Venezuela from Spanish
rule, and was elected first President of the Republic of Colombia. But
while he was fighting for the freedom of Peru, the Masonic clique was
plotting against religious freedom in Colombia. In 1821 the Colombian
Congress, which was controlled by the Masons, passed many laws directed
against the Church. The Catholic religion was disestablished, right of
censorship over books was vested in the Government alone, the right of
nominating bishops, which had been exercised by the defunct Spanish
power, was claimed, and a new plan of studies was imposed on the
ecclesiastical seminaries. Some of these regulations may appear
innocent, but the way in which they were carried out evidenced the
animus of their authors. The first books passed and approved for
publication by the government censor were the works of Voltaire and
other French atheists, and many immoral pamphlets. One of the
text-books prescribed for the universities was an atheistic work by the
English materialist Bentham. When an eminent professor protested
against this, he was thrown into prison. Such violation of religious
liberty could not occur in the United States. And yet these
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>enlightened and tolerant Masons inflicted them
on a Catholic nation. Other outrages on liberty followed. Crime stalked
abroad in the new republic; unoffending citizens were cast into prison
or beheaded on the trumped-up charge of treason. The people soon tired
of the new tyranny and clamored for Bolivar to return and liberate them
once again.</p>
<p>Bolivar returned and restored order and peace to the distracted
country. He was hated by the lodges, and his death was decreed. On
Sept. 25, 1828, a band of assassins entered his house, but fortunately
Bolivar escaped by a secret passage. That the crime had been plotted by
the Masons is evident from the decree which the President issued soon
afterwards: &ldquo;Considering that secret societies have the planning
of political revolutions for their principal object, and that their
baneful character is sufficiently manifested by the mystery with which
they surround themselves, I order the suppression of all such
societies, and the closing of their lodges.&rdquo; He re-established
religious education in the schools and universities, believing that
nothing but religion could counteract the disorders and crimes which
disgraced his beloved country. His enemies triumphed at the elections
of 1830, and Bolivar decided to resign office. His final address to
Congress is memorable. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;let my
last official act be to recommend Congress to protect continually our
holy religion, the fruitful source of the blessing of Heaven; and to
entreat Congress to restore its sacred and unprescriptible rights to
public instruction, which has been made <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>a cancer for
Colombia. Fellow-citizens, I must say, with the blush of shame on my
brow, that while we have won our independence, it has been won at the
expense of every other blessing. For twenty years I have served you as
soldier and as magistrate. During that long period we have freed our
country, procured liberty for three republics, repressed many civil
wars, and four times I have resigned to the people the supreme power
which they confided to me. To-day I fear that I may be an obstacle to
your happiness, and therefore I resign for the last time the magistracy
with which you have honored me. The most unworthy suspicions have been
expressed in my regard, and I have been unable to defend myself. A
crown has been offered to me frequently by men who are now ambitious of
supreme power, but I always refused that crown with the indignation of
a sincere republican.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The republic which he established was dismembered; his dearest
friend was assassinated, and his own picture was burned in effigy. He
was besought to return and once more guide the destinies of the
country, but he replied: &ldquo;I cannot assume an authority with which
another is invested.&rdquo; He died in his forty-eighth year, of a
broken heart. Such was the treatment which the Washington of South
America received from Freemasons.</p>
<p>Contrasting the lives of two presidents of Ecuador&mdash;Moreno, the
martyr, and Alfaro&mdash;in a previous article, we touched on the
crimes of Freemasonry in that country. After the assassination of
Moreno, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>the lodges decided not to inaugurate a very
radical policy. They were afraid of a popular outburst. But in 1877 a
drunken soldier, named Vintimilla, was proclaimed dictator, and then
the cloven hoof appeared. The usual decree for the secularization of
education was promulgated and the Catholic bishops protested. The
bishops were banished for their action, and the Archbishop of Quito,
Monsignor Chica, died under very suspicious circumstances. A
post-mortem examination revealed twelve grains of strychnine in his
stomach, but his poisoners were never brought to justice. This was
followed by a decree ordering all the pastors to celebrate requiem
masses for the souls &ldquo;of all the martyrs of holy Liberalism who
had fallen since March, 1869.&rdquo; That was the date of an
insurrection against the saintly Moreno. The priests refused to
celebrate Mass for these revolutionists, and the people sided with
them. The drunken dictator was defeated. Soon afterwards he was driven
from office and Ecuador was comparatively peaceful until Alfaro, a
cruel and ignorant soldier, seized the Government. His term has been
marked by the murder and exile of priests and bishops.</p>
<p>In Chili, the most Catholic of all South American countries, English
and German Masons made many futile attempts to secularize all the
institutions, and to degrade marriage into a merely civil contract. The
<i>Monde Maconnique</i> published the programme which had been prepared
by the &ldquo;Grand Lodge of Chili&rdquo;; and another organ of the
lodges informs us <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137"
name="pb137">137</a>]</span>that &ldquo;in Chili it is really the
English and German lodges that do the work.&rdquo; It is gratifying to
learn that all their plots came to naught, and that Chili remains a
Catholic and contented country.</p>
<p>In Peru the lodges are supported in a manner from the
&ldquo;missionary funds,&rdquo; which Protestants of this country
contribute for the spread of the Gospel among these &ldquo;benighted
Papists.&rdquo; The preachers who are sent out to Catholic countries
are too often ignorant bigots. A common mode of procedure on their part
is to attack and calumniate Catholics, and they are ready to join with
Masonry, or any other anti-Catholic society, in their fight against the
Church. So far, however, they have failed to stir up an anti-Catholic
movement in Peru.</p>
<p>Little need be added about Mexico, where the people are, for the
most part, devoutly Catholic, while the politicians are Masonic. As a
consequence the Church has been despoiled of her property and visited
with persecution. The trouble with the people of these countries is
that they allow themselves to be ruled by politicians. The same may be
said of the United States, with a difference, however: there,
politicians are allowed to misappropriate funds and to plunder
tax-payers; in Mexico and South America the Catholics, somehow or
other, permit themselves to be persecuted by the Masonic politicians.

<h2 class="main">Interview with Augustinian Friars.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">(From the <i>Catholic Standard and Times</i>,
Philadelphia, Penn.)</p>
<p>Ten Spanish priests, driven from the mission of the Philippines by
the insurrectionary movement, arrived in San Francisco on the 5th of
January by the Pacific Mail steamer Doric. They only remained a few
days in California, as their destination was New Granada, to which they
sailed the following week. A call on them while stopping at the
Occidental Hotel obtained much interesting information about the
disposition of the natives towards the clergy in the Philippine group.
All ten had been employed as parish priests in country districts, where
the population is almost wholly of native stock, without the admixture
of Chinese blood which is prevalent in Manila. Two came from Luzon,
where the Tagals are predominant; two more from Zebu, and six from
Panay. In these last islands the population is of the Visaya race.
Familiarity with the native language is required from every missionary
before he is sent out of the seminary in Manila after his arrival in
the Archipelago. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139"
name="pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p>During their passage the exiled priests, by direction of their
superiors, all wore the ordinary secular dress, and looked like a
delegation of intelligent business men from some country district in
the United States. In manner they were courteous and very intelligent;
but they were somewhat shy of talking much in a strange land. After
some time this shyness wore off, and cordial relations were established
between the exiles and your correspondent. None of the former spoke
English, though the president, Father Diaz, read it readily, and
translated offhand articles in the San Francisco papers to his
brethren. They were not familiar with the system of interviewing as
practised in California, and asked that any questions to which their
answers were desired should be put to them in Spanish and in writing.
Later they conversed freely on subjects connected with their missions,
though they declined to express themselves on political questions.
<span class="corr" id="xd20e1332" title="Source: The">They</span>
evidently regarded Aguinaldo as not a very remarkable personage, and
the calmness with which they spoke of their own experiences was very
remarkable.</p>
<p>The statement that the Friars possessed large estates in the country
was declared by them to be a pure lie. The individual members possess
nothing, and the only property held by the Orders is attached to
hospitals or colleges. The missionaries are all Europeans, though there
are many natives among the secular clergy. The Augustinians,
Franciscans, Dominicans, and Capuchins have the right of presentation
to certain parishes which were founded among <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>the
barbarous natives in older times. Each Order has a seminary in Europe
specially devoted to training such of its members as have suitable
vocations for the Philippine mission. After completing their studies,
and receiving holy orders, the young priests are sent to the seminaries
in the Philippines to perfect themselves in the native languages, and
get familiar with the habits of the country. There are three principal
languages spoken in the group,&mdash;Tagal, Visaya, and Pampanginano.
No priest is sent on mission work until he is thoroughly acquainted
with whichever of these he is destined to use in his ministry. These
Philippine languages have, it must be remembered, books and literature,
and are not mere dialects suitable to all. In answer to a question
whether as missionaries they could accumulate private funds, Father
Alvarez emphatically said no. &ldquo;We are Friars and have taken a
solemn vow of poverty,&rdquo; he stated, &ldquo;and it a simple
falsehood to assert, as some have done, that any Philippine Friar
possesses a rood of land or a peso that he can call his own, except
temporarily and by permission of his superiors.&rdquo; A couple of
other questions brought out a clearly worded account of the relations
of the Friars in the Philippines to Church and State. Some of the facts
will be new to American readers.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church in the Archipelago is organized on the same
basis as in other parts of the world, but the number of clergy is much
less in proportion to the population than in any other Catholic
country. There is one archbishop and four bishops for a population
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>of over seven millions. The dioceses are divided
into parishes, as in Spain or America, and the priests of each parish
are subject to the bishop&rsquo;s authority in the same manner. The
only peculiarity, in a church point, is that more than three-quarters
of the parishes are served by members of the different Religious
Orders&mdash;Augustinians, Dominicans, Franciscans, and Jesuits. Each
Order has the right of presenting the names of suitable priests for the
districts in its charge to the bishop, who appoints them, if
satisfactory to his own judgment, after which the Augustinian or
Franciscan occupies the ordinary position of a parish
priest&mdash;subject, however, to removal by his own superior. In
practice this is rare, and the relations between the bishops and the
Orders have been uniformly satisfactory.</p>
<p>The whole number of Augustinians in the islands in 1896 was three
hundred and twenty-seven, and the Catholic population which this number
supplied was two millions three hundred thousand, or about one priest
to every seven thousand Catholics. It certainly is not a great number,
and does not justify the common ideas of hordes of idle Friars. In
districts of over ten thousand two or more Friars are stationed, but
the great majority have only one, with a native assistant priest or
deacon in some cases. The church property is simply the church and
priest&rsquo;s house, with a garden attached. The revenue is an
allowance from the government, which varies from five hundred to eight
hundred silver dollars a year, or somewhat less than ten cents a head
for the population <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span>at large. That the three hundred Friars can
lead idle lives is hardly compatible with the number of baptisms and
marriages recorded within a year. There were a hundred and fifteen
thousand baptisms, sixteen thousand marriages, and fifty-one thousand
interments as the work of 1896 for the three hundred Friars.</p>
<p>Of the condition of the people in the islands Father Alvarez thought
it compared fairly well with the rural population of his native Spain
or other European countries. The bulk of the natives own and cultivate
their own lands. There are schools for boys and girls in every parish,
and the great majority can read and write. Of the religious spirit of
the country people and their respect for the missionaries he spoke very
favorably. The movement which drove them out was political, not
religious. Father Alvarez attributed the chief share in it to the
mestizos of Chinese and Philippine origin, who form the greater part of
the population of Manila and the larger towns. Like the Tagals and the
Visayas, these mestizos are Christians, but they possess the fondness
for secret societies of their Chinese fathers. A certain number of the
younger natives who have engaged in office seeking or business joined
in the movement, to which the bulk of the country population is wholly
indifferent.</p>
<p>The occupation of Cavite by Dewey and the destruction of the Spanish
fleet was followed by the withdrawal of the Spanish soldiers from the
remoter islands, where they had been almost the only police
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>force. Popular disturbances followed in many
places, and Aguinaldo at Cavite, through the mestizo agents, quickly
put himself in touch with the local agitators. The latter had no
definite purpose except to secure personal advancement in the change of
government, and when Aguinaldo declared Spaniards the enemies of the
Philippines, attacks were made on the isolated Spanish priests. Several
were imprisoned, some were released by their parishioners, and others
remained in the hands of the new insurgent soldiery. The heads of the
Order directed a temporary retirement, and most of the priests did so,
but returned again after some time. With the progress of
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s party more violent measures were adopted towards the
Spanish priests. The jails were opened and criminals had free scope
through the islands. In many places liquor was freely distributed by
the leaders of the insurgents, and massacres and robberies were
committed with impunity. In Illocos, in Luzon, the bishop and all the
students of the seminary and all the Spanish priests were arrested and
treated with savage brutality. More than fifty priests were murdered in
different places, and over four hundred thrown into prison and
subjected to all the brutalities that the fierce Malay spirit could
suggest. The heads of the Orders in Manila finally gave the word, and
the missionaries who were able to escape made their way to the
different places which were protected by Spanish garrisons, or to
Manila itself. In Manila, after its capture, it was impossible for the
Orders to maintain long the number of fugitive <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>priests thus driven from their homes. Their
funds are limited, and, on consultation with the generals in Rome, it
was decided to find employment for the exiles in other lands as far as
possible. In South America such employment has been offered to a number
of Augustinians. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145"

<h2 class="main">Letter from a Friar in the Power of the Rebels to
another Friar, of the same Order, Residing in Manila.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first salute"><span class="sc">Dear and Reverend
Father</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>The wife of the master of N. has come to visit us in your name, and
to offer us money. God will reward your good works and your kindness to
us. We are not accepting the help you offer us because we have no need
of it for the present. Just now we can say we are rich in comparison
with what we were some time ago. For the last two months we have not
been treated with that ferocity which was displayed against us
previously by the rebel chief holding the rank of Lieut.-Colonel, and
the guard in whose custody we were placed: He treated us in the
beginning with extreme rigor, due to his satanic hatred against
religion, and his insatiable greed. He ordered us to be scourged on
four occasions, took all our money, and, finally all we possessed. He
took our clothes, hats, and shoes, and left us nothing but miserable
rags for clothing. But the charity of the people, in spite of the
guards, who had the most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href=
"#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>severe orders to prevent them,
supplied us with all we had need of.</p>
<p>The hatred that the rebel chief has shown towards us has passed all
limits. He made us suffer for a long time most terrible humiliations
and vexations. He and his soldiers injured us in various ways and
tortured us. The attitude of the rebel chief clearly showed us that he
was a furious agent of the Freemasons. By his orders the father Vicar
of N. was tied to a tree and fiercely beaten. In addition to this bad
treatment, we were sent every day on the public roads and forced to
work till night-time. We just got what repose was strictly necessary,
and at noon a small repast&mdash;all that under a fierce sun. I was
exempted from the work on account of my sickness, and yet I had a
desire to share in the labors and sufferings of my brethren.</p>
<p>The people compassionated us and relieved us as much as possible.
They brought us tea, coffee, cigars, etc., and all that without the
knowledge of the guards, from fear of the rebel chief, who threatened
terrible punishment to all who would dare to give aid to the prisoners.
The people of N., as soon as they learnt that I was a prisoner, began
to come to see me, in spite of the long distance that separated them
from me, and brought me clothes and money with which I was able to
provide for my necessities for the time being.</p>
<p>When the rebel chief bearing the title of Lieut.-Colonel heard this
news he got into a great rage, threatened my parishioners that he would
have them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>arrested and brought before a judge. In
consequence of this they were obliged to fly, but still before their
departure they found means of giving me a little more help. The rebel
chief does not reside near us, but comes from time to time, causing
terror to everybody. Happily, his visits are rarer now, and, thanks to
God, we enjoy a certain tranquillity. It is said that he has been
reprimanded for the bad treatment he has inflicted on us. Who
knows?</p>
<p>However that may be, he comes but rarely, and leaves us in peace.
Taking advantage of this, an inhabitant of the locality in which we are
has obtained from a chief of a higher grade a remission of the hard
labor.</p>
<p>We know from a good source that all communication with the
imprisoned Friars has been forbidden under the most severe penalties.
The faithful are permitted neither to salute us nor to visit us. On
Sundays we ask permission to go to Mass, and when that is granted us we
have to go escorted by bayonets, and are not permitted to say Mass
ourselves.</p>
<p>The Governor of the locality is polite enough with us, but does not
obtain any favor for us. Fathers N. and N. have written several times
to him, begging him to get our position bettered as far as he is able.
A great number of rebel chiefs have come to see us, and all seem
possessed by a satanic hatred for us, and instead of pitying us rejoice
to see us in a state of misery.</p>
<p>They boast of having taken part in the massacres <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>of
the insurrection, and say to us: &ldquo;Fathers So-and-So have escaped
us, but if we catch them we will make them pay for their conduct. It
has been decreed to exterminate you all; however, we will allow you to
live.&rdquo; The insurgents demand freedom of worship, of teaching, of
association, civil marriage, etc. These theories are proclaimed in
public, and civil marriages have already taken place. They are
celebrated in presence of the Mayor, according to the new decree, and
the fee is five francs. The Blessed Virgin, who delivered us from
death, will deliver us also from this perilous situation, and by that
will put a seal on the favors she has already bestowed on us.</p>
<p>Kindest remembrances to all the brethren. <span class=

<h2 class="label">Appendix VI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Rev. W. Hykes on Burial Fees and the Paco Cemetery
outside Manila.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following is a sample of the Rev. Mr. Hyke&rsquo;s
report:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The burial fees demanded by the priests during
an epidemic of smallpox were something enormous. As many were unable to
pay, the dead were lying in the churches and in private houses in such
numbers as to become a serious menace to the public health. The thing
was so scandalous that the Governor-General interfered, and issued
orders for all the corpses to be buried at once. The priests
disregarded it and telegraphed to the Government at Madrid, who
reversed the order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard such a revolting story about the Paco Cemetery (Paco
is a suburb of Manila) that I decided to visit the place and ascertain
the facts for myself. In the centre of a plot of ground, containing
about two acres, is a mortuary chapel. Around this in concentric
circles, and with a space of about twenty feet between, are three or
four walls. These walls are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href=
"#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>from five to seven feet wide,
about ten feet high, and contain three tiers of vaults, one above the
other, and of sufficient size to admit a coffin. The Filipino in charge
told me that there were 1,278 vaults for adults and 504 for children.
The fees are collected five-yearly in advance, and are $33 for an adult
and $16 for a child. I said to the attendant: &lsquo;Suppose that at
the end of any period of five years the friends of the deceased are
unable to pay, what do you do?&rsquo; &lsquo;We remove the coffin, take
out the remains and throw them on the bone-pile.&rsquo; &lsquo;Will you
show me the bone-pile?&rsquo; &lsquo;Certainly.&rsquo; He conducted me
to the rear of the cemetery, up a flight of stone steps to the top of
the wall. The receptacle for the bones was a space between two parallel
walls, about thirty feet long by four wide by eight deep, and it was
nearly full. Near by were two metallic coffins which had evidently just
been opened, and on top of the bone-pile were two complete skeletons. A
dog was munching the bones. You can imagine how such a system would
work with an ignorant, superstitious people like the natives. All of
the vaults except three were occupied. The fees amount to more than
$50,000 every five years. The fees of a church near to the hotel at
which I was stopping amounted to $100,000 per annum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not surprising that the great religious corporations
are enormously wealthy, and that they have a power consonant with that
wealth. I was shocked at the stories I was told by men, whose word I
could not doubt, of the flagrant immorality of the Spanish <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>Friars. The men who gave me these statements
said they were prepared to give names, dates, and places.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>We sent a cutting containing this part of the report to the
ex-Philippine missionary, residing at present in Rome, to whom we have
already referred.</p>
<p>To these lying statements the missionary gives an unqualified
contradiction. He himself was a parish priest during the cholera of
1882&ndash;83, when 20,000 people died in six months. In his own parish
alone 1,829 died and were buried, and yet he did not get a penny for
burial fees. He adds that the other parish priests acted like
himself.</p>
<p>The revolting description of the treatment of the dead in the Paco
cemetery is a foolish fabric, built on the simple fact that bodies are
removed from certain niches, after five years, to make room for others.
Mr. Hykes indirectly imputes the extortion of enormous burial fees in
this cemetery to the clergy. Whether the fees are enormous or not, they
do not go to the Church; for the missionary Father reveals the fact
wilfully kept back by Mr. Hykes&mdash;that <i>the cemetery belongs to
the Manila municipality, which gets all the fees</i>. This cemetery
story, told with such apparent honest indignation, is alone sufficient
to discredit all Mr. Hyke&rsquo;s report, and is a proof that he knows
how to color and misrepresent facts to suit his purpose.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we are anxious to know if Mr. Hykes examined the
spiritual condition of the Protestants in the Philippines. &ldquo;To
our shame be it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152"
name="pb152">152</a>]</span>said,&rdquo; observed a British officer, in
1859, &ldquo;there is no Protestant place of worship on the island; and
even the burial-ground is in an unseemly position and condition, and, I
believe, unconsecrated.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1423src"

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
